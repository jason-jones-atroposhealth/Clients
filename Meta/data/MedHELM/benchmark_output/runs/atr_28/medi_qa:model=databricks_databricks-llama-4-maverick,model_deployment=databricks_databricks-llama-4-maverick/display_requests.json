I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health. Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in 2015. Does the term 'congenital' mean that it could be passed down to another generation? I do not want to alarm my son and his wife. I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience. Unfortunately my son and I are estranged. And I do not know who is their pediatrician. My child's CDH was very severe. I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition.
