The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through the intestines. Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by a defect in a gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). The defect makes it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins. It is an autosomal recessive condition that more often affects males. Symptoms include: - Balance and coordination difficulties - Curvature of spine - Decreased vision that gets worse over time - Developmental delay - Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy - Muscle weakness - Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10 - Protruding abdomen - Slurred speech - Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools There may be damage to the retina of the eye (retinitis pigmentosa). Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include: - Apolipoprotein B blood test - Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K) - \"Burr-cell\" malformation of the red cells (acanthocytosis) - Complete blood count (CBC) - Cholesterol studies - Electromyography - Eye exam - Nerve conduction velocity - Stool sample analysis Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the MTP gene. Treatment involves large doses of vitamin supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. People with this condition should talk to a nutritionist. Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This involves: - Limiting fat intake to 5 to 20 grams per day. - Do not eat more than 5 ounces daily (140 grams) of lean meat, fish, or poultry. - Use skim milk instead of whole milk. Supplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider. They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage. How well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. Complications may include: - Blindness - Mental deterioration - Loss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia) Call your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person. High doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.

Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 6 to 12. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may occur with other types of seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: - Occur many times a day - Occur for weeks to months before being noticed - Interfere with school and learning - Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: - Stop walking and start again a few seconds later - Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: - Wide awake - Thinking clearly - Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: - Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing - Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.

Below is a plain-language overview and a list of trustworthy places you can turn to for more detail and support.  Use it only as background\u2014final decisions about care should always be made with the child\u2019s physicians and, if possible, a medical geneticist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n1.  WHAT ALD IS\n----------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  ALD is caused by a change (mutation) in the ABCD1 gene on the X-chromosome.  \n\u2022  The faulty gene keeps certain very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) from being broken down inside tiny cell structures called peroxisomes.  These fatty acids build up, damage the insulating covering (myelin) of nerves in the brain and spinal cord, and can also injure the adrenal glands (the glands that make cortisol).  \n\u2022  Because the gene is on the X-chromosome, ALD is described as \u201cX-linked.\u201d  Boys/men (who have only one X) are the ones who usually become ill.  Girls/women who carry the mutation usually stay healthy but can pass it on and sometimes develop a milder adult form.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n2.  MAIN FORMS & TYPICAL AGE AT ONSET\n----------------------------------------------------\n1.  Childhood cerebral ALD  \n    \u2022  Onset: most often 4\u20138 years old.  \n    \u2022  Features: behavior or school performance changes, vision or hearing loss, clumsiness, seizures.  Symptoms can progress rapidly over months to a few years.\n\n2.  Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  \n    \u2022  Onset: late teens to adulthood.  \n    \u2022  Features: slowly worsening stiffness/weakness of the legs, bladder or bowel problems, possible adrenal failure.  Usually progresses over decades.\n\n3.  Addison-only form  \n    \u2022  Onset: anytime in childhood or adulthood.  \n    \u2022  Feature: adrenal insufficiency (Addison\u2019s disease) without obvious nervous-system problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n3.  SYMPTOMS TO WATCH FOR\n----------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  Learning or behavioral changes, loss of attention span  \n\u2022  Balance problems, frequent falls, leg stiffness  \n\u2022  Decreased vision, hearing, or speech difficulties  \n\u2022  Seizures  \n\u2022  Extreme fatigue, weight loss, darkening of the skin (possible adrenal failure)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n4.  HOW ALD IS DIAGNOSED\n----------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  Blood test for very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs)  \n\u2022  Brain MRI (characteristic white-matter changes)  \n\u2022  Genetic testing for an ABCD1 mutation  \n\u2022  Adrenal hormone tests (cortisol, ACTH)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n5.  TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT\n----------------------------------------------------\nThere is no cure yet, but several treatments can slow or prevent damage if started early:\n\n1.  Adrenal hormone replacement  \n    \u2022  Daily hydrocortisone or similar medications if adrenal insufficiency is present.\n\n2.

Can you help??\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (often shortened to ALD) is a rare, inherited, neuro-metabolic disorder.  Below is a plain-language overview and a list of trustworthy places you can turn to for more detail and support.  Use it only as background\u2014final decisions about care should always be made with the child\u2019s physicians and, if possible, a medical geneticist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n1.  WHAT ALD IS\n----------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  ALD is caused by a change (mutation) in the ABCD1 gene on the X-chromosome.  \n\u2022  The faulty gene keeps certain very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) from being broken down inside tiny cell structures called peroxisomes.  These fatty acids build up, damage the insulating covering (myelin) of nerves in the brain and spinal cord, and can also injure the adrenal glands (the glands that make cortisol).  \n\u2022  Because the gene is on the X-chromosome, ALD is described as \u201cX-linked.\u201d  Boys/men (who have only one X) are the ones who usually become ill.  Girls/women who carry the mutation usually stay healthy but can pass it on and sometimes develop a milder adult form.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n2.  MAIN FORMS & TYPICAL AGE AT ONSET\n----------------------------------------------------\n1.  Childhood cerebral ALD  \n    \u2022  Onset: most often 4\u20138 years old.  \n    \u2022  Features: behavior or school performance changes, vision or hearing loss, clumsiness, seizures.  Symptoms can progress rapidly over months to a few years.\n\n2.  Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  \n    \u2022  Onset: late teens to adulthood.  \n    \u2022  Features: slowly worsening stiffness/weakness of the legs, bladder or bowel problems, possible adrenal failure.  Usually progresses over decades.\n\n3.  Addison-only form  \n    \u2022  Onset: anytime in childhood or adulthood.  \n    \u2022  Feature: adrenal insufficiency (Addison\u2019s disease) without obvious nervous-system problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n3.  SYMPTOMS TO WATCH FOR\n----------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  Learning or behavioral changes, loss of attention span  \n\u2022  Balance problems, frequent falls, leg stiffness  \n\u2022  Decreased vision, hearing, or speech difficulties  \n\u2022  Seizures  \n\u2022  Extreme fatigue, weight loss, darkening of the skin (possible adrenal failure)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n4.  HOW ALD IS DIAGNOSED\n----------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  Blood test for very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs)  \n\u2022  Brain MRI (characteristic white-matter changes)  \n\u2022  Genetic testing for an ABCD1 mutation  \n\u2022  Adrenal hormone tests (cortisol, ACTH)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n5.  TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT\n----------------------------------------------------\nThere is no cure yet, but several treatments can slow or prevent damage if started early:\n\n1.  Adrenal hormone replacement  \n    \u2022  Daily hydrocortisone or similar medications if adrenal insufficiency is present.\n\n2.  Hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) or gene-corrected stem-cell therapy  \n    \u2022  Can halt the childhood cerebral form if done very early, before major symptoms appear (requires specialized centers).\n\n3.

These disorders are passed down (inherited) in families. Adrenoleukodystrophy is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait. It affects mostly males, although some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races. The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body. There are 3 major categories of disease: - Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8) - Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life - Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones Childhood cerebral type symptoms include: - Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements - Crossed eyes - Handwriting that gets worse - Difficulty at school - Difficulty understanding what people are saying - Hearing loss - Hyperactivity - Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis - Seizures - Swallowing difficulties - Visual impairment or blindness Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include: - Difficulty controlling urination - Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness - Problems with thinking speed and visual memory Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include: - Coma - Decreased appetite - Increased skin color - Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting) - Muscle weakness - Vomiting Tests for this condition include: - Blood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland - Chromosome study to look for changes (mutations) in the ABCD1 gene - MRI of the head Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition. The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs. The other forms of this disease are milder. These complications can occur: - Adrenal crisis - Vegetative state Call your health care provider if: - Your child develops symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy - Your child has X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and is getting worse Genetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition. Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is also available. It is done by testing cells from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These tests look for either a known genetic change in the family or for very long chain fatty acid levels.

Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Because this cancer progresses very slowly and sometimes doesn't progress at all, some people prefer to wait to treat their cancer only if it causes signs and symptoms. The majority of people with hairy cell leukemia eventually need treatment. If your hairy cell leukemia causes signs and symptoms, you may decide to undergo treatment. There is no cure for hairy cell leukemia. But treatments are effective at putting hairy cell leukemia in remission for years. Chemotherapy Doctors consider chemotherapy drugs the first line of treatment for hairy cell leukemia. The great majority of people will experience complete or partial remission through the use of chemotherapy. Two chemotherapy drugs are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Cladribine. Treatment for hairy cell leukemia typically begins with cladribine. You receive a continuous infusion of the drug into a vein over several days. Most people who receive cladribine experience a complete remission that can last for several years. If your hairy cell leukemia returns, you can be treated with cladribine again. Side effects of cladribine may include infection and fever. - Pentostatin (Nipent). Pentostatin causes remission rates similar to cladribine, but it's given on a different schedule. People who take pentostatin receive infusions every other week for three to six months. Side effects of pentostatin may include fever, nausea and infection. Biological treatments Biological therapy attempts to make cancer cells more recognizable to your immune system. Once your immune system identifies cancer cells as intruders, it can set about destroying your cancer. Two types of biological treatments are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Interferon. Currently, the role of interferon in hairy cell leukemia treatment is limited. You might receive interferon if chemotherapy hasn't been effective or if you can't take chemotherapy. Most people experience partial remission with interferon, which is taken for a year. Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as fever and fatigue. - Rituximab (Rituxan). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though it's sometimes used in hairy cell leukemia. If chemotherapy drugs haven't worked for you or you can't take chemotherapy, your doctor might consider rituximab. Side effects of rituximab include fever and infection. Surgery Surgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy) might be an option if your spleen ruptures or if it's enlarged and causing pain. Though removing your spleen can't cure hairy cell leukemia, it can usually restore normal blood counts. Splenectomy isn't commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia, but it may be helpful in certain situations. Any surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Address dry mouth (xerostomia)\n   Mouth dryness lets odor-producing bacteria multiply.  \n   \u2022 Sip water frequently; aim for 6\u20138 glasses/day.  \n   \u2022 Chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free mints to stimulate saliva.  \n   \u2022 Limit caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco\u2014all can dry the mouth.  \n   \u2022 Some medications cause dry mouth; talk with your prescribing doctor if you think this is a factor.  \n\n4. Review diet and habits\n   \u2022 Foods like onions, garlic, certain spices, coffee, and alcohol can linger in your breath until they\u2019re metabolized.  \n   \u2022 High-protein, low-carb diets sometimes cause a \u201cketone\u201d smell.  \n   \u2022 Smoking and vaping directly cause bad breath and gum disease. Quitting helps almost immediately.  \n\n5. Consider sinus, throat, or respiratory issues\n   Chronic sinusitis, post-nasal drip, tonsil stones, and certain chest infections can all create odor. Signs include nasal congestion, thick mucus, or a chronic sore throat. An ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor can evaluate these.\n\n6. Digestive, metabolic, or systemic conditions\n   \u2022 Acid reflux (GERD) can bring stomach acids\u2014and odor\u2014into the throat and mouth.  \n   \u2022 Uncontrolled diabetes can give breath a sweet or fruity odor.  \n   \u2022 Kidney or liver disorders sometimes cause a fishy or ammonia-like smell.  \n   If symptoms point in these directions (heartburn, stomach pain, frequent urination, fatigue, swelling, yellowing skin/eyes), see your primary-care provider.\n\n7. Keep dentures or appliances spotless\n   If you wear dentures, retainers, or aligners, clean them exactly as instructed and store them in antibacterial solutions when not in use.\n\n8. Track patterns\n   \u2022 Note when your breath seems worst\u2014after certain foods, first thing in the morning, when you\u2019re stressed, etc.  \n   \u2022 A brief log can help your dentist or physician pinpoint triggers.\n\n9. Be realistic about mouthwashes and mints\n   These mask odor temporarily. If you need them constantly, it\u2019s a sign you should find and treat the underlying cause.\n\nWhen to seek professional help quickly\n   \u2022 Persistent bad breath despite good home care for 2\u20133 weeks.  \n   \u2022 Loose teeth, gum recession, or painful, swollen gums.  \n   \u2022 Mouth sores that don\u2019t heal in 1\u20132 weeks.  \n   \u2022 Chronic dry mouth or thick stringy saliva.  \n   \u2022 Other unexplained symptoms (fever, weight loss, severe heartburn, persistent cough).\n\nBottom line\nBad breath usually improves with diligent oral hygiene and dental care. If it doesn\u2019t, consult a dentist first\u2014most halitosis originates in the mouth. If dental causes are ruled out, your dentist may refer you to a medical doctor or specialist (ENT, gastroenterologist, endocrinologist) to look for non-oral sources.",

Address dry mouth (xerostomia)\n   Mouth dryness lets odor-producing bacteria multiply.  \n   \u2022 Sip water frequently; aim for 6\u20138 glasses/day.  \n   \u2022 Chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free mints to stimulate saliva.  \n   \u2022 Limit caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco\u2014all can dry the mouth.  \n   \u2022 Some medications cause dry mouth; talk with your prescribing doctor if you think this is a factor.  \n\n4. Review diet and habits\n   \u2022 Foods like onions, garlic, certain spices, coffee, and alcohol can linger in your breath until they\u2019re metabolized.  \n   \u2022 High-protein, low-carb diets sometimes cause a \u201cketone\u201d smell.  \n   \u2022 Smoking and vaping directly cause bad breath and gum disease. Quitting helps almost immediately.  \n\n5. Consider sinus, throat, or respiratory issues\n   Chronic sinusitis, post-nasal drip, tonsil stones, and certain chest infections can all create odor. Signs include nasal congestion, thick mucus, or a chronic sore throat. An ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor can evaluate these.\n\n6. Digestive, metabolic, or systemic conditions\n   \u2022 Acid reflux (GERD) can bring stomach acids\u2014and odor\u2014into the throat and mouth.  \n   \u2022 Uncontrolled diabetes can give breath a sweet or fruity odor.  \n   \u2022 Kidney or liver disorders sometimes cause a fishy or ammonia-like smell.  \n   If symptoms point in these directions (heartburn, stomach pain, frequent urination, fatigue, swelling, yellowing skin/eyes), see your primary-care provider.\n\n7. Keep dentures or appliances spotless\n   If you wear dentures, retainers, or aligners, clean them exactly as instructed and store them in antibacterial solutions when not in use.\n\n8. Track patterns\n   \u2022 Note when your breath seems worst\u2014after certain foods, first thing in the morning, when you\u2019re stressed, etc.  \n   \u2022 A brief log can help your dentist or physician pinpoint triggers.\n\n9. Be realistic about mouthwashes and mints\n   These mask odor temporarily. If you need them constantly, it\u2019s a sign you should find and treat the underlying cause.\n\nWhen to seek professional help quickly\n   \u2022 Persistent bad breath despite good home care for 2\u20133 weeks.  \n   \u2022 Loose teeth, gum recession, or painful, swollen gums.  \n   \u2022 Mouth sores that don\u2019t heal in 1\u20132 weeks.  \n   \u2022 Chronic dry mouth or thick stringy saliva.  \n   \u2022 Other unexplained symptoms (fever, weight loss, severe heartburn, persistent cough).\n\nBottom line\nBad breath usually improves with diligent oral hygiene and dental care. If it doesn\u2019t, consult a dentist first\u2014most halitosis originates in the mouth. If dental causes are ruled out, your dentist may refer you to a medical doctor or specialist (ENT, gastroenterologist, endocrinologist) to look for non-oral sources.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat is Bad Breath?: There are many reasons why you might have bad breath. You can get it if you don't brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as gum disease, dry mouth or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad aroma. Some diseases and medicines are associated with a specific breath odor. Having good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have an underlying disorder, treating it may help eliminate the breath odor.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth. Cancer treatment can be local or systemic: - Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast. - Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment. Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (recurring). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured. - Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma: Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment. - Stage I and II: Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery. - Stage III: Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy. - Stage IV: Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments. After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment to monitor for the return of cancer or development of another breast cancer. Women who have had a mastectomy may have reconstructive breast surgery. This will be done either at the time of mastectomy or later.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

More than 100 types of peripheral neuropathy have been identified, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms, pattern of development, and prognosis. Impaired function and symptoms depend on the type of nerves -- motor, sensory, or autonomic -- that are damaged.\u00a0 Some people may experience temporary numbness, tingling, and pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle weakness. Others may suffer more extreme symptoms, including burning pain (especially at night), muscle wasting, paralysis, or organ or gland dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathy may be either inherited or acquired. Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy include physical injury (trauma) to a nerve, tumors, toxins, autoimmune responses, nutritional deficiencies, alcoholism, medical procedures, and vascular and metabolic disorders. Acquired peripheral neuropathies are caused by systemic disease, trauma from external agents, or infections or autoimmune disorders affecting nerve tissue. Inherited forms of peripheral neuropathy are caused by inborn mistakes in the genetic code or by new genetic mutations.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Please use it as general guidance only and be sure your fianc\u00e9e is evaluated and treated by a qualified clinician.\n\n1. What pneumonia is  \n\u2022 Pneumonia is an inflammation of the air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs.  \n\u2022 In most cases it is caused by an infection\u2014\u00adbacteria, viruses, or (less commonly) fungi.  \n\u2022 Much more rarely, it can be non-infectious (e.g., chemical or aspiration pneumonia).  \n\n2. Is it contagious?  \nYes\u2014\u00adbut only while the illness is active and only for certain kinds:  \n\u2022 Bacterial and viral pneumonias can be spread the same way a cold or influenza is\u2014through droplets from coughing or sneezing, or on contaminated hands.  \n\u2022 Once the correct treatment has started and the fever has been gone for 24\u201348 hours, the vast majority of bacterial pneumonias are no longer contagious.  \n\u2022 Viral pneumonias (often linked to influenza, COVID-19, RSV, etc.) are contagious for several days\u2014usually until fever resolves and symptoms start improving.  \n\u2022 Pneumonia caused by fungi, aspiration, or irritants is not contagious.  \n\n3. Can it be completely cured?  \nNearly always, yes. Cure rates in otherwise healthy adults approach 100 % when:  \n\u2022 The correct diagnosis is made early,  \n\u2022 The right antibiotics (for bacteria) or antivirals/supportive care (for viruses) are given, and  \n\u2022 The patient follows the full course of medication and gets adequate rest, fluids, and follow-up.  \n\nMost people feel much better within a week, though the cough and fatigue may linger two to six weeks. A tiny minority develop complications (pleural effusion, lung abscess, sepsis) that prolong recovery\u2014another reason prompt medical care is important.\n\n4. What you can do to help her now  \n\u2022 Encourage her to see a doctor right away (or return if she already went and is not improving). A chest X-ray or lung ultrasound, blood/\u200bsputum tests, and a physical exam identify the cause and guide treatment.  \n\u2022 If bacterial pneumonia is confirmed, ensure she takes the entire antibiotic course\u2014even if she feels well sooner.  \n\u2022 Help her rest, stay hydrated, eat nutritious meals, and avoid smoking or exposure to smoke.  \n\u2022 Watch for \u201cred-flag\u201d symptoms that need urgent care: trouble breathing, high fever that will not come down, blue-tinged lips or fingertips, severe chest pain, confusion, or vomiting that prevents taking medicines.  \n\u2022 Once her doctor says she is past the contagious period, you do not need to worry about catching it from her. Frequent hand-washing and avoiding kissing/\u200bclose contact while she is still febrile are sensible precautions.  \n\u2022 If influenza, COVID-19, or another specific virus is suspected, you may be offered vaccination or prophylactic medication, depending on local guidelines.  \n\n5. Longer-term outlook and your marriage plans  \n\u2022 Pneumonia is an acute (short-term) illness, not a lifelong disease. Once she has recovered, there is no ongoing risk to you.  \n\u2022 Having had pneumonia does not affect fertility, marriage prospects, or life expectancy, provided there is no serious underlying lung or immune disorder.  \n\u2022 People who have had one bout of pneumonia do not automatically keep getting it. However, if she is a smoker, has asthma, COPD, diabetes, HIV, or another condition that weakens lung defenses, managing that condition sharply reduces future risk.  \n\n6. Preventive steps for both of you  \n\u2022 Influenza vaccination every year and (if a doctor recommends it, usually after age 19 with risk factors or after 65) pneumococcal vaccination.  \n\u2022 Stop smoking and avoid second-hand smoke.  \n\u2022 Hand hygiene, covering coughs, and staying up-to-date on COVID-19 boosters.  \n\u2022 Prompt treatment of colds or flu-like illnesses if they worsen.  \n\nKey take-away  \nPneumonia is common, usually infectious while active, and almost always curable with timely professional care. Support your fianc\u00e9e in getting proper treatment, follow the doctor\u2019s advice on avoiding close contact until the contagious period has passed, and help her through recovery. Once she is well, there should be no lingering threat to either of you or to your future together.\n\nIf you have any doubts about her progress, or if new or worsening symptoms appear, seek medical attention immediately.",

People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more. Specific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include: - Antibiotics. These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic. - Cough medicine. This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it's a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest. - Fever reducers/pain relievers. You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort. These include drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Hospitalization You may need to be hospitalized if: - You are older than age 65 - You are confused about time, people or places - Your kidney function has declined - Your systolic blood pressure is below 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or your diastolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg or below - Your breathing is rapid (30 breaths or more a minute) - You need breathing assistance - Your temperature is below normal - Your heart rate is below 50 or above 100 You may be admitted to the intensive care unit if you need to be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator) or if your symptoms are severe. Children may be hospitalized if: - They are younger than age 2 months - They are lethargic or excessively sleepy - They have trouble breathing - They have low blood oxygen levels - They appear dehydrated\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re facing so many overlapping problems.  Below is general information you can use to discuss options with your physicians.  It is not a substitute for an in-person medical evaluation.\n\n1.  Verify the diagnoses  \n   \u2022 Cushing\u2019s syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and the various forms of muscular dystrophy can share symptoms (pain, weakness, fatigue, insomnia, weight changes).  \n   \u2022 Ask that each diagnosis be confirmed (or ruled out) by the appropriate work-up:  \n     \u2013  Endocrinologist for Cushing\u2019s (24-hr urinary cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, dexamethasone suppression test; pituitary/adrenal imaging).  \n     \u2013  Rheumatologist or pain specialist for fibromyalgia (widespread pain index, symptom severity scale, exclusion of other rheumatologic disorders).  \n     \u2013  Neuromuscular specialist for suspected muscular dystrophy (CK enzyme level, EMG/NCV, muscle MRI, genetic testing, muscle biopsy).  \n     \u2013  Infectious-disease or internal-medicine physician familiar with ME/CFS criteria.\n\n2.  Treat what is treatable first  \n   \u2022 Cushing\u2019s syndrome.  If cortisol excess is still active, lowering cortisol often improves muscle weakness, blood pressure, weight, mood and sleep.  Options include surgery (pituitary or adrenal), steroid-blocking drugs (ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat), or targeted pituitary radiation.  \n   \u2022 Secondary problems caused by Cushing\u2019s\u2014diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis\u2014also need aggressive management because they worsen fatigue and muscle loss.\n\n3.  Muscular dystrophy (MD)  \n   \u2022 There are 30+ genetic MD subtypes.  Cardiac involvement is common in Duchenne, Becker, limb-girdle, myotonic and facioscapulohumeral dystrophies.  \n   \u2022 Once the exact subtype is known, your care team can look for specific or emerging therapies (e.g., exon-skipping or gene replacement trials for Duchenne/Becker; steroids or vamorolone in Duchenne; myotonic dystrophy studies using antisense oligonucleotides).  \n   \u2022 Standard care:  \n     \u2013  Cardiac: annual or bi-annual ECG, echocardiogram or cardiac MRI; beta-blocker or ACE-inhibitor started early if any cardiomyopathy appears.  An implantable defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker is sometimes recommended.  \n     \u2013  Pulmonary: bedside spirometry; cough-assist device; non-invasive ventilation if night-time hypoventilation develops.  \n     \u2013  Musculoskeletal: physical therapy focused on low-impact stretching, contracture prevention and core stability, plus orthotics/splints if needed.  \n     \u2013  Occupational therapy: energy-saving techniques, adaptive equipment for dressing, bathing, cooking.  \n     \u2013  Nutrition: maintain healthy weight; vitamin D, calcium and adequate protein (1.2\u20131.5 g/kg/day).  \n     \u2013  Psychology: counseling for coping, fear, depression, sleep disturbance.\n\n4.  Fibromyalgia (FM) & chronic fatigue syndrome/ME  \n   These conditions don\u2019t damage muscle tissue but magnify pain, sleep disruption and cognitive \u201cfog.\u201d  Treating them can reduce the overall symptom load even if MD persists.  \n   \u2022 Medications: duloxetine, milnacipran, low-dose amitriptyline or cyclobenzaprine at night, pregabalin or gabapentin, low-dose naltrexone.  \n   \u2022 Non-drug strategies: gentle graded aerobic activity (water therapy, recumbent bike), supervised strength work below the pain threshold, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, neuromodulation (TENS).  \n   \u2022 Sleep: rule out sleep apnea; practice strict sleep hygiene; consider trazodone, low-dose doxepin or melatonin.\n\n5.  Multidisciplinary care  \n   \u2022 Ideally you would be followed at a neuromuscular center or an academic medical center that has Endocrinology, Neurology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, and Pain Management all in one place.  \n   \u2022 Ask for a designated care coordinator or case manager to help schedule same-day appointments to reduce travel and fatigue.\n\n6.  Exercise without overexertion  \n   \u2022 \u201cToo much\u201d exercise can worsen both MD and ME/CFS; \u201ctoo little\u201d leads to contractures, deconditioning and additional weakness.  \n   \u2022 Aim for 5\u201315 min sessions of very low-intensity activity spaced through the day (chair yoga, resistance bands, pool walking) and slowly increase by 1\u20132 min every 1\u20132 weeks if tolerated.  \n   \u2022 Monitor heart rate: keep it below ",

        "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nCushing, fybromyaglia, Chronic fatigue my main concern is no treatment and the musclar distrophy effecting my heart, legs feet, shoulders, arms, etc.\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re facing so many overlapping problems.  Below is general information you can use to discuss options with your physicians.  It is not a substitute for an in-person medical evaluation.\n\n1.  Verify the diagnoses  \n   \u2022 Cushing\u2019s syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and the various forms of muscular dystrophy can share symptoms (pain, weakness, fatigue, insomnia, weight changes).  \n   \u2022 Ask that each diagnosis be confirmed (or ruled out) by the appropriate work-up:  \n     \u2013  Endocrinologist for Cushing\u2019s (24-hr urinary cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, dexamethasone suppression test; pituitary/adrenal imaging).  \n     \u2013  Rheumatologist or pain specialist for fibromyalgia (widespread pain index, symptom severity scale, exclusion of other rheumatologic disorders).  \n     \u2013  Neuromuscular specialist for suspected muscular dystrophy (CK enzyme level, EMG/NCV, muscle MRI, genetic testing, muscle biopsy).  \n     \u2013  Infectious-disease or internal-medicine physician familiar with ME/CFS criteria.\n\n2.  Treat what is treatable first  \n   \u2022 Cushing\u2019s syndrome.  If cortisol excess is still active, lowering cortisol often improves muscle weakness, blood pressure, weight, mood and sleep.  Options include surgery (pituitary or adrenal), steroid-blocking drugs (ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat), or targeted pituitary radiation.  \n   \u2022 Secondary problems caused by Cushing\u2019s\u2014diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis\u2014also need aggressive management because they worsen fatigue and muscle loss.\n\n3.  Muscular dystrophy (MD)  \n   \u2022 There are 30+ genetic MD subtypes.  Cardiac involvement is common in Duchenne, Becker, limb-girdle, myotonic and facioscapulohumeral dystrophies.  \n   \u2022 Once the exact subtype is known, your care team can look for specific or emerging therapies (e.g., exon-skipping or gene replacement trials for Duchenne/Becker; steroids or vamorolone in Duchenne; myotonic dystrophy studies using antisense oligonucleotides).  \n   \u2022 Standard care:  \n     \u2013  Cardiac: annual or bi-annual ECG, echocardiogram or cardiac MRI; beta-blocker or ACE-inhibitor started early if any cardiomyopathy appears.  An implantable defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker is sometimes recommended.  \n     \u2013  Pulmonary: bedside spirometry; cough-assist device; non-invasive ventilation if night-time hypoventilation develops.  \n     \u2013  Musculoskeletal: physical therapy focused on low-impact stretching, contracture prevention and core stability, plus orthotics/splints if needed.  \n     \u2013  Occupational therapy: energy-saving techniques, adaptive equipment for dressing, bathing, cooking.  \n     \u2013  Nutrition: maintain healthy weight; vitamin D, calcium and adequate protein (1.2\u20131.5 g/kg/day).  \n     \u2013  Psychology: counseling for coping, fear, depression, sleep disturbance.\n\n4.  Fibromyalgia (FM) & chronic fatigue syndrome/ME  \n   These conditions don\u2019t damage muscle tissue but magnify pain, sleep disruption and cognitive \u201cfog.\u201d  Treating them can reduce the overall symptom load even if MD persists.  \n   \u2022 Medications: duloxetine, milnacipran, low-dose amitriptyline or cyclobenzaprine at night, pregabalin or gabapentin, low-dose naltrexone.  \n   \u2022 Non-drug strategies: gentle graded aerobic activity (water therapy, recumbent bike), supervised strength work below the pain threshold, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, neuromodulation (TENS).  \n   \u2022 Sleep: rule out sleep apnea; practice strict sleep hygiene; consider trazodone, low-dose doxepin or melatonin.\n\n5.  Multidisciplinary care  \n   \u2022 Ideally you would be followed at a neuromuscular center or an academic medical center that has Endocrinology, Neurology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, and Pain Management all in one place.  \n   \u2022 Ask for a designated care coordinator or case manager to help schedule same-day appointments to reduce travel and fatigue.\n\n6.  Exercise without overexertion  \n   \u2022 \u201cToo much\u201d exercise can worsen both MD and ME/CFS; \u201ctoo little\u201d leads to contractures, deconditioning and additional weakness.  \n   \u2022 Aim for 5\u201315 min sessions of very low-intensity activity spaced through the day (chair yoga, resistance bands, pool walking) and slowly increase by 1\u20132 min every 1\u20132 weeks if tolerated.  \n   \u2022 Monitor heart rate: keep it below \n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nFibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Migraine and other types of headaches - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome - Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The cervix is\u00a0the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer\u00a0usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: - Having sex at an early age - Having multiple sexual partners - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: - Not getting the HPV vaccine - Being economically disadvantaged - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: - Back pain - Bone pain or fractures - Fatigue - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina - Leg pain - Loss of appetite - Pelvic pain - Single swollen leg - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions: - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis. - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination. - A procedure called a\u00a0cone biopsy may also be done. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include: - Chest x-ray - CT scan of the pelvis - Cystoscopy - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on: - The stage of the cancer - The size and shape of the tumor - The woman's age and general health - Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include: - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed. Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including: - Type of cervical cancer - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread) - Age and general health - If the cancer comes back after treatment Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include: - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you: - Have not had regular Pap smears - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

Work with your diabetes care team to find the specific cause and safest solution for you.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nDiabetes type 2 - meal planning (Function): Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has: - Food from all the food groups - Fewer calories - About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack - Healthy fats Along with healthy eating, you can help\u00a0keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. Persons with type 2 diabetes are often overweight. Losing just 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 30 to 60 minutes of walking per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food. The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day). Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition. The following tips can help your child stay on track: - No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep it in target range. - Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control. - Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk. PLANNING MEALS Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you. When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices. A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate. EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. VEGETABLES (2\u00bd to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day) Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro.\u00a0Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable. FRUITS (1\u00bd to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day) Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups. GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day) There are 2 types of grains: - Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa. - Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice. Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast. PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6\u00bd ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day) Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil. DAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day) Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label. OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day) Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature. Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter. Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters). WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS? If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you. Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small. Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets: - Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others. - Eat sweets that are sugar-free. - Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size. YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team.

People with SPS respond to high doses of diazepam and several anti-convulsants, gabapentin and tiagabine.\u00a0\u00a0A recent study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and stress in people with SPS.\u00a0 Treatment with IVIg, anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and pain relievers will improve the symptoms of SPS, but will not cure the disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Most individuals with SPS have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe.\u00a0\u00a0With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

What \u201ccongenital\u201d means  \n\u2022 \u201cCongenital\u201d simply means \u201cpresent at birth.\u201d  \n\u2022 A congenital condition may be genetic (inherited), may be the result of a new genetic change that happened only in that pregnancy, or may have no identifiable genetic cause at all. In other words, \u201ccongenital\u201d does not automatically mean \u201cruns in families.\u201d\n\n2. How often CDH is inherited  \n\u2022 CDH occurs in about 1 in 2,500\u20134,000 live births.  \n\u2022 About 80\u201385 % of CDH cases are \u201cisolated,\u201d meaning the baby has no other birth-defects or chromosome problems. In these isolated cases, the vast majority are sporadic (happen once in a family with no known cause).  \n\u2022 Roughly 15\u201320 % of CDH cases are part of a genetic syndrome or a chromosome abnormality. When CDH is syndromic, the pattern of inheritance\u2014autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, or chromosome-related\u2014depends on the specific disorder.\n\n3.

I just learned that this condition most likely caused the death of my first child back in 1971. I was then told it was merely a fluke. I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health. Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in 2015. Does the term 'congenital' mean that it could be passed down to another generation? I do not want to alarm my son and his wife. I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience. Unfortunately my son and I are estranged. And I do not know who is their pediatrician. My child's CDH was very severe. I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition. Please respond to my concerns.\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nI\u2019m very sorry for the loss of your first child and understand why you want clear, up-to-date information before deciding whether or how to share it with your son.  \nBelow is a plain-language summary of what specialists know about congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and its chances of occurring again in a family.\n\n1. What \u201ccongenital\u201d means  \n\u2022 \u201cCongenital\u201d simply means \u201cpresent at birth.\u201d  \n\u2022 A congenital condition may be genetic (inherited), may be the result of a new genetic change that happened only in that pregnancy, or may have no identifiable genetic cause at all. In other words, \u201ccongenital\u201d does not automatically mean \u201cruns in families.\u201d\n\n2. How often CDH is inherited  \n\u2022 CDH occurs in about 1 in 2,500\u20134,000 live births.  \n\u2022 About 80\u201385 % of CDH cases are \u201cisolated,\u201d meaning the baby has no other birth-defects or chromosome problems. In these isolated cases, the vast majority are sporadic (happen once in a family with no known cause).  \n\u2022 Roughly 15\u201320 % of CDH cases are part of a genetic syndrome or a chromosome abnormality. When CDH is syndromic, the pattern of inheritance\u2014autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, or chromosome-related\u2014depends on the specific disorder.\n\n3. Recurrence risks quoted by genetics centers  \nIsolated CDH (no chromosome or syndrome identified)  \n\u2022 Risk to the parents\u2019 future children (i.e., to the baby\u2019s brothers/sisters): about 1\u20132 %.  \n\u2022 Risk to that child\u2019s future children (i.e., to your grandchildren): roughly 1 % or less.  \nCDH as part of a known genetic syndrome or chromosome change  \n\u2022 The recurrence risk can be much higher or lower, depending on the exact condition.

The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1 in 2,500 newborns. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.

The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy may be used before surgery as well, with the goal of shrinking the cancer before an operation. Chemotherapy before surgery is more common in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. Chemotherapy can also be given to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells, to shrink large tumors before an operation so that they can be removed more easily, or to relieve symptoms of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Radiation therapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options for the initial management of rectal cancer followed by surgery. Targeted drug therapy Drugs that target specific malfunctions that allow cancer cells to grow are available to people with advanced colon cancer, including: - Bevacizumab (Avastin) - Cetuximab (Erbitux) - Panitumumab (Vectibix) - Ramucirumab (Cyramza) - Regorafenib (Stivarga) - Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) Targeted drugs can be given along with chemotherapy or alone. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs. Until more is known, doctors carefully weigh the possible benefit of targeted drugs against the risk of side effects and the cost when deciding whether to use these treatments. Immunotherapy Some patients with advanced colon cancer have a chance to benefit from immunotherapy with antibodies such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo). Whether a colon cancer has the chance to respond to these immunotherapies can be determined by a specific test of the tumor tissue. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

If you've tried lifestyle changes and home remedies for diarrhea without success, your doctor might recommend medications or other treatments. Antibiotics Antibiotics might help treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. If a virus is causing your diarrhea, antibiotics won't help. Treatment to replace fluids Your doctor likely will advise you to replace the fluids and salts. For most adults, that means drinking water, juice or broth. If drinking liquids upsets your stomach or causes diarrhea, your doctor might recommend getting fluids through a vein in your arm (intravenously). Water is a good way to replace fluids, but it doesn't contain the salts and electrolytes - minerals such as sodium and potassium - you need to maintain the electric currents that keep your heart beating. You can help maintain your electrolyte levels by drinking fruit juices for potassium or eating soups for sodium. Certain fruit juices, such as apple juice, might make diarrhea worse. For children, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to prevent dehydration or replace lost fluids. Adjusting medications you're taking If your doctor determines that an antibiotic caused your diarrhea, your doctor might lower your dose or switch to another medication. Treating underlying conditions If your diarrhea is caused by a more serious condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, your doctor will work to control that condition. You might be referred to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, who can help devise a treatment plan for you.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

DMD causes progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of skeletal and heart muscles. [1] Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. The calves may be enlarged. Children with DMD may have an unusual walk and difficulty running, climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor. [2] DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills. [3] Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. [2] DMD is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the DMD gene . The DMD gene codes for the protein dystrophin. [1] [2] Dystrophin is mainly made in skeletal and heart muscle cells , but a small amount is also made in nerve cells\u00a0(neurons) in specific parts of the brain. [3] DMD is\u00a0 inherited in an X-linked recessive \u00a0pattern; however, it\u00a0may also\u00a0occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. [2]\u00a0 While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. [4] Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood. [2] [3] Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) is also caused by mutations in the DMD gene. People with BMD have less severe symptoms than DMD. In addition, symptoms start later in childhood or in adolescence and progress more slowly. [1] Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually noticed in boys between 1 to 6 years of age. There is a steady decline in muscle strength between the ages of 6 and 11 years. By age 10, braces may be required for walking, and by age 13, most boys with DMD are confined to a wheelchair. The signs and symptoms are as follows: [1] [2] [3] Taking longer to learn to sit, stand, or walk on own, which is known as delayed motor development. The mean age for walking in boys with DMD is 18 months. Having a waddling walk or gait, difficulty climbing stairs, and running due to progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvic muscles and progressive loss of muscle mass (wasting or atrophy).\u00a0 Difficulty getting up from the floor. Child may walk his hands up his legs to stand which is known as the\u00a0Gower maneuver. Enlargement of calf muscles due to the calf muscle cells being\u00a0 Muscle weakness first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. Tight or rigid joints (also known as contractures ) may develop as muscle loss progresses. If not treated, these will become severe, causing discomfort and restricting mobility and flexibility. Contractures can affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. Scoliosis may develop within several years of being confined to a wheelchair. By the early teens, the respiratory and heart muscles are also affected. Breathing problems due to weakness of the diaphragm and the other muscles supporting the operation of the lungs. Skeletal changes, such as scoliosis, may also increase breathing problems. Breathing problems may become life threatening. Progressive enlargement of the heart ( cardiomyopathy ) develops. This stops the heart from pumping blood efficiently, and becomes life-threatening in many cases. Learning and memory issues (cognitive impairment) may occur in some cases, but do not worsen as the DMD progresses. Communication may be more difficult for some. Social behavior may be affected, as well as the ability to read facial cues.\u00a0\u00a0 The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene . The DMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. Dystophin is primarily made in the muscle cells of the heart and skeletal muscle. The main job of dystrophin in muscle cells is to help stabilize and protect muscle fibers. [1] [2] [3]\u00a0 DMD is caused by genetic changes in the DMD gene that stop any functional dystrophin from being made. [2] When dystrophin is missing, the muscle cells become damaged more easily. In response to the damage, inflammation occurs, which only worsens the process. Over time, the muscle cells without dystrophin weaken and die, leading to the muscle weakness and heart problems seen in DMD. [2] [3] The non-progressive memory and learning problems, as well as social behavioral problems, in some boys with DMD are most likely linked to loss of dystrophin in the neurons of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain where dystrophin is normally produced in small amounts, but at this point it is not known why this occurs and why only some people with DMD have these problems. [3]\u00a0 Different genetic changes in the DMD gene can cause a spectrum of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. The dystrophinopathies can range from very mild symptoms to the more severe symptoms seen in people with DMD. Other dystrophinopathies include Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). [2] Genetic changes causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be passed down in families. The DMD gene is located on the X chromosome , one of the two types of sex chromosomes . Males have an X and a Y chromosome ; whereas females have two X chromosomes . Since males only have one X chromosome, they also only have one copy of the DMD gene. If this copy has a genetic change that causes DMD, the male will have DMD. Males get their X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father. [1] [2]\u00a0 Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the DMD gene. Having two changed copies of the DMD gene that can cause DMD is unlikely, but would cause DMD in females. A female with only one changed copy of the DMD gene is called a \" carrier \". She can pass on the changed gene, but usually does not have symptoms of DMD. Carriers of changes in the DMD gene that can cause DMD are at an increased risk of developing heart problems, including cardiomyopathy . In addition, due to a process called X-inactivation , in rare cases, female carriers may have mild, moderate, or severe DMD. [2] If a man with DMD has children, all of his daughters will be carriers. Since boys inherit the Y chromosome from their father, sons will not inherit DMD from their fathers, even if the father has DMD. [1] [2] DMD DMD DMD DMD A child's doctor may suspect Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys who have the signs and symptoms of DMD, including progressive muscle weakness. Family history is also important. Blood tests can be used to check for\u00a0 increased levels of certain special proteins called muscle enzymes in the blood which can leak from damaged muscles. Most commonly, the blood level of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) is checked, but a doctor may also check the blood levels of transaminases such as aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Finding a change in the DMD gene that can cause DMD through genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of DMD. [2] [5]\u00a0\u00a0 Testing for DMD may include: [2] [5]\u00a0 Blood test which measures the levels of serum creatine phosphokinase Molecular genetic testing Electromyography Muscle biopsy is rarely used to diagnose DMD due to the decreased cost and higher accuracy of genetic testing. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life.\u00a0An enlarged, weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a\u00a0 heart transplant\u00a0may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. [2] [6] Physical therapy Steroids\u00a0( corticosteroids ) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function. Steroid options include: [2] [6] Prednisone \u00a0is\u00a0a steroid that has been shown to extend the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain, high blood pressure , behavior changes, and delayed growth. Deflazacort (another form of prednisone), is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects and was recently approved in the United States by the FDA. Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, also has similar benefits to prednisone, but with fewer side effects. Management Guidelines Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope. Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include any of the following: - Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation) - Chest pain not related to eating - Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids - Heartburn - Vomiting blood - Weight loss Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include: - Barium swallow - Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease) - Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease) - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy - PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible) Stool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool. Upper endoscopy (EGD) will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery will be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using: - Open surgery, during which one or two larger incisions are made. - Minimally invasive surgery, during which a 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions. Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus. Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable. Beside a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include: - Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open. - A feeding tube into the stomach. - Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival. When the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Complications may include: - Pneumonia - Severe weight loss from not eating enough Call your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better. Also call if you have other symptoms of esophageal cancer. To reduce your risk of cancer of the esophagus: - DO NOT smoke - Limit or DO NOT drink alcoholic beverages - Get checked by your doctor if you have severe GERD - Get regular checkups if you have Barrett esophagus Updated by: Subodh K.

Surgery may be more risky for people with serious medical problems. Surgery repairs the weakened abdominal wall tissue (fascia) and closes any holes. Most hernias are closed with stitches and sometimes with mesh patches to plug the hole. An umbilical hernia that does not heal on its own by the time a child is 5 years old will likely be repaired.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

You may have to try a few treatments to see what works best for you. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment plan.Changes in eating, diet, and nutrition, such as following a FODMAP diet, can help treat your symptoms.Your doctor may recommend medicine to relieve your symptoms.Fiber supplements to relieve constipation when increasing fiber in your diet doesn\u2019t help. Laxatives to help with constipation. Laxatives work in different ways, and your doctor can recommend a laxative that\u2019s right for you. Loperamide to reduce diarrhea by slowing the movement of stool through your colon. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal that reduces diarrhea in people with IBS, though it doesn\u2019t reduce pain, bloating, or other symptoms. Antispasmodics, such as hyoscine, cimetropium, and pinaverium, help to control colon muscle spasms and reduce pain in your abdomen.\u00a0 Antidepressants, such as low doses of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, to relieve IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. In theory, because of their effect on colon transit, tricyclic antidepressants should be better for people with IBS with diarrhea, or IBS-D, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be better for people with IBS with constipation, or IBS-C, although studies haven\u2019t confirmed this theory. Tricyclic antidepressants work in people with IBS by reducing their sensitivity to pain in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as normalizing their GI motility and secretion. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) for people who have IBS-C to improve abdominal pain or discomfort and constipation symptoms.\u00a0 Linaclotide (Linzess) for people who have IBS-C to relieve abdominal pain and increase how often you have bowel movements. The antibiotic rifaximin to reduce bloating by treating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. However, experts are still debating and researching the use of antibiotics to treat IBS. Coated peppermint oil capsules to reduce IBS symptoms.Follow your doctor\u2019s instructions when you use medicine to treat IBS. Talk with your doctor about possible side effects and what to do if you have them.Some medicines can cause side effects. Ask your doctor and your pharmacist about side effects before taking any medicine. MedlinePlus maintains the latest information about side effects and drug warnings.Your doctor may also recommend probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms\u2014tiny organisms that can be seen only with a microscope. These microorganisms, most often bacteria, are like the microorganisms that are normally present in your GI tract. Studies have found that taking large enough amounts of probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, can improve symptoms of IBS. However, researchers are still studying the use of probiotics to treat IBS.You can find probiotics in dietary supplements, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt.Discuss your use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including probiotics and dietary supplements, with your doctor.Psychological therapies may improve your IBS symptoms.Managing StressLearning to reduce stress can help improve IBS. With less stress, you may find you have less cramping and pain. You may also find it easier to manage your symptoms.Some options for managing stress includetaking part in stress reduction and relaxation therapies such as meditation getting counseling and support taking part in regular exercise such as walking or yoga reducing stressful life situations as much as possible getting enough sleepTalk TherapyTalk therapy may reduce stress and improve your IBS symptoms. Two types of talk therapy that health care professionals use to treat IBS are cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic, or interpersonal, therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on your thoughts and actions. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on how your emotions affect your IBS symptoms. This type of therapy often involves relaxation and stress management techniques.Gut-Directed HypnotherapyIn gut-directed hypnotherapy, a therapist uses hypnosis to help you relax the muscles in the colon.Mindfulness TrainingMindfulness training can teach you to focus your attention on sensations occurring at the moment and to avoid catastrophizing, or worrying about the meaning of those sensations.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) happens when the capsule that surrounds the shoulder joint becomes inflamed and then gradually tightens and thickens, producing pain and loss of motion.  In the general population it affects only about 2-5 % of adults, so having 10 of 14 brothers and sisters affected is clearly unusual and worth looking into.\n\nWhy it might be running in your family  \n\n1. Shared medical conditions  \n   \u2022 Diabetes \u2013 Type 1 and especially Type 2 increase frozen-shoulder risk by three- to five-fold. Diabetes itself often runs in families.  \n   \u2022 Thyroid disease (both under- and over-active) \u2013 also frequently familial.  \n   \u2022 Other endocrine or metabolic problems: lipid disorders, low vitamin D, or hormonal changes around menopause.  \n   \u2022 Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, Parkinson\u2019s disease, heart disease, and stroke are less common but known associations.\n\n2. Genetic (hereditary) predisposition  \n   \u2022 Studies have shown that first-degree relatives of someone with frozen shoulder have a three-fold higher risk, even when diabetes and thyroid illness are ruled out.  \n   \u2022 Research is pointing toward variations in genes involved in collagen formation and immune regulation. These genes can make the shoulder capsule more prone to scarring once it becomes inflamed.\n\n3. Shared lifestyle or environmental factors  \n   \u2022 All siblings may have similar jobs, sports, or daily activities that limit shoulder motion or cause small repetitive injuries.  \n   \u2022 If many of you have had postoperative immobilisation (e.g., after mastectomy, heart surgery, fractures) that could be a common trigger.\n\nShould you be concerned?  \n\nFrozen shoulder is painful and inconvenient but usually not dangerous, and in most people it eventually improves (often 1\u20133 years) with proper treatment.  The concern is not so much the shoulder itself as the conditions that are linked to it\u2014especially diabetes and thyroid disease\u2014that can affect general health.\n\nWhat to do  \n\n\u2022 Medical review: Each affected sibling should be screened, or re-screened, for:  \n  \u2013 Fasting blood glucose or HbA1c (diabetes)  \n  \u2013 Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and, if abnormal, free T4 (thyroid function)  \n  \u2013 Lipid profile and blood pressure (cardiovascular risk)  \n  \u2022 Mention the strong family clustering to your health-care provider; it may prompt earlier imaging or referral if symptoms arise.  \n\n\u2022 Early shoulder management:  \n  \u2013 Begin gentle range-of-motion exercises as soon as pain allows.  \n  \u2013 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen for pain; some people need a short oral steroid taper or a cortisone injection.  \n  \u2013 Physical therapy focusing on stretching, pendulum exercises, and eventually strengthening.  \n  \u2013 If therapy fails, options include hydrodilatation (saline injection to stretch the capsule), manipulation under anaesthesia, or arthroscopic capsular release.\n\n\u2022 Preventive tips for relatives not (yet) affected:  \n  \u2013 Keep the shoulder moving through its full range daily; if you have an arm injury or surgery, ask for early motion protocols.  \n  \u2013 Control blood sugar, weight, and thyroid issues promptly.  \n\nIn short, a strong hereditary component is very likely in your family, but clustered underlying medical problems\u2014especially diabetes and thyroid disease\u2014could also be playing a role. Bring this up with your primary-care provider so that appropriate screenings are done and, if needed, specialist referral (orthopaedic surgeon, endocrinologist, or geneticist) can be arranged.",

        "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nWe have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder. We are wondering why? should we be concerned?\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nFrozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) happens when the capsule that surrounds the shoulder joint becomes inflamed and then gradually tightens and thickens, producing pain and loss of motion.  In the general population it affects only about 2-5 % of adults, so having 10 of 14 brothers and sisters affected is clearly unusual and worth looking into.\n\nWhy it might be running in your family  \n\n1. Shared medical conditions  \n   \u2022 Diabetes \u2013 Type 1 and especially Type 2 increase frozen-shoulder risk by three- to five-fold. Diabetes itself often runs in families.  \n   \u2022 Thyroid disease (both under- and over-active) \u2013 also frequently familial.  \n   \u2022 Other endocrine or metabolic problems: lipid disorders, low vitamin D, or hormonal changes around menopause.  \n   \u2022 Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, Parkinson\u2019s disease, heart disease, and stroke are less common but known associations.\n\n2. Genetic (hereditary) predisposition  \n   \u2022 Studies have shown that first-degree relatives of someone with frozen shoulder have a three-fold higher risk, even when diabetes and thyroid illness are ruled out.  \n   \u2022 Research is pointing toward variations in genes involved in collagen formation and immune regulation. These genes can make the shoulder capsule more prone to scarring once it becomes inflamed.\n\n3. Shared lifestyle or environmental factors  \n   \u2022 All siblings may have similar jobs, sports, or daily activities that limit shoulder motion or cause small repetitive injuries.  \n   \u2022 If many of you have had postoperative immobilisation (e.g., after mastectomy, heart surgery, fractures) that could be a common trigger.\n\nShould you be concerned?  \n\nFrozen shoulder is painful and inconvenient but usually not dangerous, and in most people it eventually improves (often 1\u20133 years) with proper treatment.  The concern is not so much the shoulder itself as the conditions that are linked to it\u2014especially diabetes and thyroid disease\u2014that can affect general health.\n\nWhat to do  \n\n\u2022 Medical review: Each affected sibling should be screened, or re-screened, for:  \n  \u2013 Fasting blood glucose or HbA1c (diabetes)  \n  \u2013 Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and, if abnormal, free T4 (thyroid function)  \n  \u2013 Lipid profile and blood pressure (cardiovascular risk)  \n  \u2022 Mention the strong family clustering to your health-care provider; it may prompt earlier imaging or referral if symptoms arise.  \n\n\u2022 Early shoulder management:  \n  \u2013 Begin gentle range-of-motion exercises as soon as pain allows.  \n  \u2013 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen for pain; some people need a short oral steroid taper or a cortisone injection.  \n  \u2013 Physical therapy focusing on stretching, pendulum exercises, and eventually strengthening.  \n  \u2013 If therapy fails, options include hydrodilatation (saline injection to stretch the capsule), manipulation under anaesthesia, or arthroscopic capsular release.\n\n\u2022 Preventive tips for relatives not (yet) affected:  \n  \u2013 Keep the shoulder moving through its full range daily; if you have an arm injury or surgery, ask for early motion protocols.  \n  \u2013 Control blood sugar, weight, and thyroid issues promptly.  \n\nIn short, a strong hereditary component is very likely in your family, but clustered underlying medical problems\u2014especially diabetes and thyroid disease\u2014could also be playing a role. Bring this up with your primary-care provider so that appropriate screenings are done and, if needed, specialist referral (orthopaedic surgeon, endocrinologist, or geneticist) can be arranged.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nFrozen shoulder: Frozen shoulder is a condition in which the shoulder is painful and loses motion because of inflammation. The capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint. Most of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Risk factors include: - Diabetes - Thyroid problems - Changes in your hormones, such as during menopause - Shoulder injury - Shoulder surgery - Open heart surgery - Cervical disk disease of the neck - Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected Main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are: - Decreased motion of the shoulder - Pain - Stiffness Frozen shoulder without any known cause starts with pain. This pain prevents you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you. Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made when you are not able to rotate your shoulder. You may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an MRI exam shows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder. Pain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion. It can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 6 to 9 months for complete recovery. Physical therapy is intense and needs to be done every day. Left untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little loss of motion. Risk factors for frozen shoulder, such as diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated. Surgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (shoulder arthroscopy) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy. Follow instructions on caring for your shoulder at home.\u00a0 Treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years. After surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you\u00a0do not\u00a0keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back. Complications may include: - Stiffness and pain continue even with therapy - The arm can break if the shoulder is moved forcefully during surgery If you have shoulder pain and stiffness and think you have a frozen shoulder, contact your provider for referral and treatment. Early treatment may help prevent stiffness. Call your provider if you develop shoulder pain that limits your range of motion for an extended period. People who have diabetes or thyroid problems will be less likely to get frozen shoulder if they keep their condition under control. Updated by: C.

Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis includegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetitegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomachpain in the stomach areaabdominal bloatinglack of appetiteSymptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting.

The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Gastric emptying breath test. Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.MedicationsSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement.Metoclopramide (Reglan).Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.Erythromycin.Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.Other medications.Botulinum ToxinBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.11Gastric Electrical StimulationThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.JejunostomyIf medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe.Parenteral NutritionWhen gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen.To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need totake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessarytake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they taketake insulin after meals, instead of beforecheck blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessaryA health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis.In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. The problems of gastroparesis can includesevere dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptomssevere dehydration due to persistent vomitinggastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagusbezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill formdifficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetesmalnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intakedecreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition.

Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. What causes gastroparesis? Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetite Symptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. How is gastroparesis diagnosed? Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting.

What are the problems of gastroparesis? The problems of gastroparesis can include severe dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Points to Remember Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.

Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition. For people with gastroparesis and diabetes, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen. References [1] Bai Y, Xu MJ, Yang X, et al.

What it is  \n\u2022 \u201cGlaucoma\u201d is a group of eye diseases that gradually damage the optic nerve (the cable that carries visual information from your eye to your brain).  \n\u2022 Most\u2014but not all\u2014forms are related to higher-than-normal pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure, IOP).\n\n2. Common types  \n\u2022 Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) \u2013 the most common form in the U.S.; usually painless and slow-moving.  \n\u2022 Angle-closure (narrow-angle) glaucoma \u2013 less common, can cause sudden pain, redness, or blurred vision and is an emergency.  \n\u2022 Normal-tension glaucoma \u2013 optic-nerve damage occurs even though eye pressure is in the \u201cnormal\u201d range.  \n\u2022 Secondary and congenital glaucomas \u2013 linked to other eye problems, medications, injuries, or present at birth.\n\n3. Symptoms  \n\u2022 Early POAG usually has no symptoms\u2014regular eye exams are essential.  \n\u2022 As the disease advances, side (peripheral) vision narrows; untreated, this can progress to tunnel vision or blindness.  \n\u2022 Sudden eye pain, headache, halos around lights, or nausea can signal angle-closure glaucoma\u2014seek care immediately.\n\n4. Diagnosis  \n\u2022 Comprehensive dilated eye exam with:  \n  \u2013 Tonometry (eye-pressure test)  \n  \u2013 Gonioscopy (angle check)  \n  \u2013 Ophthalmoscopy (optic-nerve exam)  \n  \u2013 Visual-field testing and optic-nerve imaging  \n\u2022 Because damage is permanent but preventable, most experts recommend a baseline exam at age 40, earlier for those at higher risk.\n\n5. Risk factors  \n\u2022 Age > 60 (or > 40 for African, Afro-Caribbean, or Hispanic heritage)  \n\u2022 Family history of glaucoma  \n\u2022 Elevated IOP  \n\u2022 Thin corneas, severe nearsightedness or farsightedness, previous eye injury or surgery  \n\u2022 Diabetes, high blood pressure, migraine, steroid use\n\n6. Treatment goals  \nLowering intraocular pressure to a level your optic nerve can tolerate. Treatments do not cure glaucoma but can halt or slow damage.\n\n7. Treatment options  \n\u2022 Prescription eye drops (prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists, Rho-kinase inhibitors, miotics)  \n\u2022 Oral medications (less common now)  \n\u2022 Laser procedures (SLT, ALT, or laser peripheral iridotomy for angle-closure)  \n\u2022 Minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS)  \n\u2022 Traditional surgeries (trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage devices)  \nYour ophthalmologist will tailor therapy, often starting with drops or laser and monitoring pressure, optic-nerve appearance, and visual fields over time.\n\n8. Self-care & follow-up  \n\u2022 Take every dose of medication exactly as prescribed\u2014missing doses lets pressure rise.  \n\u2022 Learn proper drop-instillation technique; ask your provider to watch you do it.  \n\u2022 Keep all follow-up appointments even if your vision seems fine.  \n\u2022 Tell every health-care provider you have glaucoma (some meds such as steroids may raise eye pressure).  \n\u2022 Protect your eyes from injury (sports goggles), eat a balanced diet rich in leafy greens and fish, stay active, and control blood pressure/diabetes.  \n\u2022 Stop smoking; limit excessive caffeine, which can temporarily raise eye pressure.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nWHERE TO GET PRINTED OR DIGITAL PATIENT MATERIALS\n-------------------------------------------------\nAll of the organizations below will mail free brochures on request and have excellent online content as well.\n\n1.

Symptoms  \n\u2022 Early POAG usually has no symptoms\u2014regular eye exams are essential.  \n\u2022 As the disease advances, side (peripheral) vision narrows; untreated, this can progress to tunnel vision or blindness.  \n\u2022 Sudden eye pain, headache, halos around lights, or nausea can signal angle-closure glaucoma\u2014seek care immediately.\n\n4. Diagnosis  \n\u2022 Comprehensive dilated eye exam with:  \n  \u2013 Tonometry (eye-pressure test)  \n  \u2013 Gonioscopy (angle check)  \n  \u2013 Ophthalmoscopy (optic-nerve exam)  \n  \u2013 Visual-field testing and optic-nerve imaging  \n\u2022 Because damage is permanent but preventable, most experts recommend a baseline exam at age 40, earlier for those at higher risk.\n\n5. Risk factors  \n\u2022 Age > 60 (or > 40 for African, Afro-Caribbean, or Hispanic heritage)  \n\u2022 Family history of glaucoma  \n\u2022 Elevated IOP  \n\u2022 Thin corneas, severe nearsightedness or farsightedness, previous eye injury or surgery  \n\u2022 Diabetes, high blood pressure, migraine, steroid use\n\n6. Treatment goals  \nLowering intraocular pressure to a level your optic nerve can tolerate. Treatments do not cure glaucoma but can halt or slow damage.\n\n7. Treatment options  \n\u2022 Prescription eye drops (prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists, Rho-kinase inhibitors, miotics)  \n\u2022 Oral medications (less common now)  \n\u2022 Laser procedures (SLT, ALT, or laser peripheral iridotomy for angle-closure)  \n\u2022 Minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS)  \n\u2022 Traditional surgeries (trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage devices)  \nYour ophthalmologist will tailor therapy, often starting with drops or laser and monitoring pressure, optic-nerve appearance, and visual fields over time.\n\n8. Self-care & follow-up  \n\u2022 Take every dose of medication exactly as prescribed\u2014missing doses lets pressure rise.  \n\u2022 Learn proper drop-instillation technique; ask your provider to watch you do it.  \n\u2022 Keep all follow-up appointments even if your vision seems fine.  \n\u2022 Tell every health-care provider you have glaucoma (some meds such as steroids may raise eye pressure).  \n\u2022 Protect your eyes from injury (sports goggles), eat a balanced diet rich in leafy greens and fish, stay active, and control blood pressure/diabetes.  \n\u2022 Stop smoking; limit excessive caffeine, which can temporarily raise eye pressure.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nWHERE TO GET PRINTED OR DIGITAL PATIENT MATERIALS\n-------------------------------------------------\nAll of the organizations below will mail free brochures on request and have excellent online content as well.\n\n1.

This nerve sends the images you see to your brain. Most often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure. Watch this video about: Glaucoma Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma: - Open-angle glaucoma - Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma - Congenital glaucoma - Secondary glaucoma The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye. - In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow. - In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden. - Either type can damage the optic nerve. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. - The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it. - The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision. - Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. - Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack. - Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency. - If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your health care provider is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye. Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: - Drugs such as corticosteroids - Eye diseases such as uveitis (an infection of the middle layer of the eye) - Diseases such as diabetes - Eye injury Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies. - It often runs in families. - It is present at birth. - It is caused when the eye does not develop normally. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - Most people have no symptoms. - Once vision loss occurs, the damage is already severe. - Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision). - Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness. ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: - Sudden, severe pain in one eye - Decreased or cloudy vision, often called \"steamy\" vision - Nausea and vomiting - Rainbow-like halos around lights - Red eye - Eye feels swollen CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old. - Cloudiness of the front of the eye - Enlargement of one eye or both eyes - Red eye - Sensitivity to light - Tearing SECONDARY GLAUCOMA - Symptoms are most often related to the underlying problem causing the glaucoma. - Depending on the cause, symptoms may either be like open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. - You will be given a test to check your eye pressure. This is called tonometry. - In most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil. - When your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve. Eye pressure is different at different times of the day. Eye pressure can even be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include: - Using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy). - Photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of your eye (optic nerve imaging). - Checking your retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. - Checking how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response). - 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination). - Testing the clearness of your vision (visual acuity). - Testing your field of vision (visual field measurement). The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops. - You may need more than one type. Most people can be treated with eye drops. - Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past. - You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye. If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment: - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out. - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure. - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack. - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack. CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery. - This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain. SECONDARY GLAUCOMA If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions. Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision. Babies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early. How you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition. If you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma. You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. But you can help prevent vision loss. - A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. - All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. - If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40. - You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss. Updated by: Franklin W.

But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year. Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results. The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss. Medication If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months. Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are: - Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits. Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). - Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits. Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets. Surgery In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left. During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results. Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring. Wigs and hairpieces You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available. If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months. If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it. Back braces can be adjusted as you grow. Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis. You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly. Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible: - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs. - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together. - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still. Scoliosis treatment may also include: - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace. - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. You may need treatments for any complications that you have. Healthy lifestyle changes To help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend that you adopt lifelong healthy lifestyle changes. Heart-healthy eating. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It\u2019s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Use the Body Weight Planner to find out your daily calorie needs and to set goals. Visit healthy recipes and plan for success. Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. Visit Chose My Plate or 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for more information. Physical activity. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Physical activity is an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Visit Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits for more information. Healthy Sleep. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Read Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency more information. Making lifelong healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and physical activity, can help you modify your energy balance to help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight. For example: To aim for a healthy weight, or lose weight, you want your energy OUT to be more than your energy IN. To maintain weight loss you want your energy IN and energy OUT to be the same.\u00a0 Behavioral weight-loss programs Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. Read Living With\u00a0for more information about required follow-up for these behavioral treatment programs. Read more Did you know your brain\u2019s pleasure and reward centers can be stimulated by food and the act of eating, making it harder to change eating patterns and lose weight? Researchers know that our brains can become patterned so that we feel pleasure or reward from eating. This can make us unconsciously crave food so our bodies feel that sense of pleasure. It can also make it hard to change our eating patterns, lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers are studying whether cognitive behavioral therapies can be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity by retraining the brain to not associate pleasure with food and the act of eating. Medicines When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. These medicines work in the following parts of your body. Brain. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Weight loss medicines are not recommended as a single treatment for weight loss. These medicines can help you lose weight but when combined with lifestyle changes may result in greater weight loss. Some of these medicines should not be used if you have certain conditions or are taking certain medicines. Also, these medicines have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breast feeding, or have a family history of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke. Surgical procedures Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. A small part of the stomach is connected to the middle part of the intestine, bypassing the first part of intestine. This decreases the amount of food that you can eat and the amount of fat your body can take in and store. Gastrectomy. A big portion of the stomach is removed to decrease the amount of food that you can eat. Gastric banding. A hollow band is placed around the upper part of the stomach creating a smaller stomach. This decreases the amount of food you can eat. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, internal rupture of sutures, or even death. Read gastric bypass surgery for more information. Read more Interested in learning why these surgeries lead to weight loss in some patients? First, these surgeries reduce the amount of food stored in the stomach and the amount of calories your body can take in. This can help your body restore energy balance. Second, these surgeries change the levels of certain hormones and the way the brain responds to these hormones to control hunger urges. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery. Look for Living With\u00a0will explain recommendations that your doctor may give, including lifelong healthy lifestyle changes and medical care to prevent your condition from recurring, getting worse, or causing complications. Research for Your Health\u00a0will explain how we are using current research and advancing research to treat people with overweight and obesity. Participate in NHLBI Clinical Trials\u00a0will discuss our ongoing clinical studies that are investigating treatments for overweight and obesity.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "Below is an up-to-date, plain-language overview of HIV treatment that you can adapt for flyers, orientation packets, or discussion groups with transgender women living with HIV.  Everything is referenced to current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, but it is meant for general information only\u2014patients should always make final decisions with their own clinicians.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. HIV BASICS AND WHY EARLY TREATMENT MATTERS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 HIV attacks the immune system (mainly CD4 cells).  \n\u2022 Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses the virus so that it cannot make copies of itself.  \n\u2022 Starting ART as soon as possible\u2014ideally the day of diagnosis\u2014keeps the immune system strong, prevents AIDS-related illnesses, and almost eliminates the risk of transmitting HIV to sexual partners (U = U: Undetectable = Untransmittable).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. STANDARD HIV DRUG CLASSES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nMost modern \u201cone-pill-once-a-day\u201d regimens combine drugs from at least two classes:  \n\u2022 Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) \u2013 e.g., dolutegravir, bictegravir (fewest drug interactions; preferred in many guidelines).  \n\u2022 Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) \u2013 e.g., tenofovir alafenamide or disoproxil, emtricitabine, lamivudine.  \n\u2022 Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) \u2013 e.g., doravirine, rilpivirine.  \n\u2022 Protease inhibitors (PIs) \u2013 e.g., darunavir/cobicistat or /ritonavir (potent but more metabolic side effects).  \nLong-acting injectable ART (cabotegravir + rilpivirine every 4\u20138 weeks) was FDA-approved in 2021 for patients who are already virally suppressed and want an alternative to daily pills.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRANSGENDER WOMEN\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHormone therapy  \n\u2022 Estradiol can interact with certain HIV meds that are metabolized in the liver (cytochrome P450).  \n   \u2013 Boosted protease inhibitors (e.g., darunavir/ritonavir) and the NNRTI efavirenz may reduce estradiol levels or increase estradiol side effects.  \n   \u2013 INSTI-based regimens (bictegravir, dolutegravir) have minimal impact on estradiol and are generally first-line choices.  \n\u2022 Recommendation: Prescribe ART and gender-affirming hormones together, monitor hormone levels and clinical effects every 3\u20136 months, and adjust doses as needed.  \nFertility & reproductive health  \n\u2022 Estradiol does not reduce ART effectiveness for preventing transmission.  \n\u2022 For patients planning sperm preservation or other reproductive options, coordinate timing with viral-load suppression goals.  \nMental health, stigma & violence  \n\u2022 High rates of depression, anxiety, and exposure to violence can affect treatment adherence. Trauma-informed counseling and peer navigation improve outcomes.  \nBody composition  \n\u2022 Both estrogen and some ART agents can change fat distribution; discuss healthy diet, exercise, and lipid/glucose monitoring.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. WHAT \u201cGOOD QUALITY HIV CARE\u201d LOOKS LIKE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 A welcoming, gender-affirming environment (correct names/pronouns, inclusive forms, gender-neutral bathrooms).  \n\u2022 Integrated services: HIV primary care, hormone therapy, PrEP/PEP for partners, STI screening, mental health, substance-use treatment, case management, legal aid.  \n\u2022 Lab monitoring: viral load and CD4 every 3\u20136 months; basic safety labs (kidney, liver, lipids) at baseline and at least annually, sooner if on tenofovir disoproxil or boosted PIs.  \n\u2022 Vaccinations: Hep A & B, HPV, influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19, mpox per local guidance.  \n\u2022 Prevention services: Free condoms, syringe-service programs, and partner services (contact tracing, expedited partner treatment).  \n\u2022 Peer or community health worker support to help with appointment reminders, pharmacy pickup, and navigating insurance or ADAP (AIDS Drug Assistance Program).  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. ADHERENCE & PRACTICAL TIPS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Take pills at the same time every day; link to a daily habit (brushing teeth or phone alarm).  \n\u2022 Refill 7\u201310 days early to avoid gaps; most states allow 90-day mail-order refills.  \n\u2022 Side-effects are usually mild (temporary headache, nausea). Persistent problems (insomnia, weight gain, depression, diarrhea) should trigger a switch rather than stopping therapy.  \n\u2022 Alcohol or recreational drugs do not \u201ccancel out\u201d ART, but missing doses does.",

        "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nhi my name is I'm currently working with and I was wondering I came across some of you healthy tip fliers for HIV/Aids treatment .at the moment we have a study going on that helps HIV positive transgender women into HIV quality care .so it would be great to have some more information on HIV/Aids treatment\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nBelow is an up-to-date, plain-language overview of HIV treatment that you can adapt for flyers, orientation packets, or discussion groups with transgender women living with HIV.  Everything is referenced to current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, but it is meant for general information only\u2014patients should always make final decisions with their own clinicians.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. HIV BASICS AND WHY EARLY TREATMENT MATTERS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 HIV attacks the immune system (mainly CD4 cells).  \n\u2022 Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses the virus so that it cannot make copies of itself.  \n\u2022 Starting ART as soon as possible\u2014ideally the day of diagnosis\u2014keeps the immune system strong, prevents AIDS-related illnesses, and almost eliminates the risk of transmitting HIV to sexual partners (U = U: Undetectable = Untransmittable).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. STANDARD HIV DRUG CLASSES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nMost modern \u201cone-pill-once-a-day\u201d regimens combine drugs from at least two classes:  \n\u2022 Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) \u2013 e.g., dolutegravir, bictegravir (fewest drug interactions; preferred in many guidelines).  \n\u2022 Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) \u2013 e.g., tenofovir alafenamide or disoproxil, emtricitabine, lamivudine.  \n\u2022 Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) \u2013 e.g., doravirine, rilpivirine.  \n\u2022 Protease inhibitors (PIs) \u2013 e.g., darunavir/cobicistat or /ritonavir (potent but more metabolic side effects).  \nLong-acting injectable ART (cabotegravir + rilpivirine every 4\u20138 weeks) was FDA-approved in 2021 for patients who are already virally suppressed and want an alternative to daily pills.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRANSGENDER WOMEN\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHormone therapy  \n\u2022 Estradiol can interact with certain HIV meds that are metabolized in the liver (cytochrome P450).  \n   \u2013 Boosted protease inhibitors (e.g., darunavir/ritonavir) and the NNRTI efavirenz may reduce estradiol levels or increase estradiol side effects.  \n   \u2013 INSTI-based regimens (bictegravir, dolutegravir) have minimal impact on estradiol and are generally first-line choices.  \n\u2022 Recommendation: Prescribe ART and gender-affirming hormones together, monitor hormone levels and clinical effects every 3\u20136 months, and adjust doses as needed.  \nFertility & reproductive health  \n\u2022 Estradiol does not reduce ART effectiveness for preventing transmission.  \n\u2022 For patients planning sperm preservation or other reproductive options, coordinate timing with viral-load suppression goals.  \nMental health, stigma & violence  \n\u2022 High rates of depression, anxiety, and exposure to violence can affect treatment adherence. Trauma-informed counseling and peer navigation improve outcomes.  \nBody composition  \n\u2022 Both estrogen and some ART agents can change fat distribution; discuss healthy diet, exercise, and lipid/glucose monitoring.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. WHAT \u201cGOOD QUALITY HIV CARE\u201d LOOKS LIKE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 A welcoming, gender-affirming environment (correct names/pronouns, inclusive forms, gender-neutral bathrooms).  \n\u2022 Integrated services: HIV primary care, hormone therapy, PrEP/PEP for partners, STI screening, mental health, substance-use treatment, case management, legal aid.  \n\u2022 Lab monitoring: viral load and CD4 every 3\u20136 months; basic safety labs (kidney, liver, lipids) at baseline and at least annually, sooner if on tenofovir disoproxil or boosted PIs.  \n\u2022 Vaccinations: Hep A & B, HPV, influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19, mpox per local guidance.  \n\u2022 Prevention services: Free condoms, syringe-service programs, and partner services (contact tracing, expedited partner treatment).  \n\u2022 Peer or community health worker support to help with appointment reminders, pharmacy pickup, and navigating insurance or ADAP (AIDS Drug Assistance Program).  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. ADHERENCE & PRACTICAL TIPS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Take pills at the same time every day; link to a daily habit (brushing teeth or phone alarm).  \n\u2022 Refill 7\u201310 days early to avoid gaps; most states allow 90-day mail-order refills.  \n\u2022 Side-effects are usually mild (temporary headache, nausea). Persistent problems (insomnia, weight gain, depression, diarrhea) should trigger a switch rather than stopping therapy.  \n\u2022 Alcohol or recreational drugs do not \u201ccancel out\u201d ART, but missing doses does.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHIV/AIDS (Treatment): One of NIAID\u2019s greatest success stories is that its research led to the development of numerous antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, turning what was once a uniformly fatal disease into a manageable chronic condition for many. NIAID is working to find new and more effective therapeutic products, drug classes, and combinations as well as safe and effective treatments for dangerous related co-infections and complications.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "Genu-valgum (\u201cknock-knees\u201d) means that, when you stand with your knees touching, your ankles remain apart.  \nIn small children it is usually a normal growth phase and straightens on its own, but once the growth plates of the long bones close (around age 16-18 in men) the bony alignment is fixed. At 23 years old you therefore have an adult pattern of knock-knees and the options are different from those offered to children.\n\n1. Confirm the cause and severity  \n   \u2022 Make an appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon (preferably one who specialises in lower-limb deformity).  \n   \u2022 The doctor will take a full history, examine your gait, measure the angle of the deformity and order standing long-leg X-rays.  \n   \u2022 Blood tests may be ordered if a metabolic bone problem (e.g., untreated rickets, renal osteodystrophy) is suspected.\n\n2. Non-surgical measures (help symptoms, do NOT usually change alignment at your age)  \n   \u2022 Physiotherapy \u2013 exercises that strengthen the hip abductors, quadriceps and hamstrings, and stretch tight structures (iliotibial band, adductors) can improve knee tracking and reduce pain.  \n   \u2022 Weight management \u2013 extra body weight increases knee load and can accelerate arthritis.  \n   \u2022 Proper footwear or lateral-wedged insoles prescribed by a physiotherapist or orthotist can shift some of the force toward the outer (lateral) knee compartment and provide comfort during walking or running.  \n   \u2022 Activity modification if you have pain (avoid deep squats, high-impact jumping until strength improves).  \n   These steps often relieve discomfort and protect the joints but will not straighten the legs.\n\n3.

The legs turn inward. Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart. By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position). Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as: - Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed) - Osteomyelitis (bone infection) - Overweight or obesity - Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D) A health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development. Knock knees are not treated in most cases. If the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace. This brace is attached to a shoe. Surgery may be considered for knock knees that are severe and continue beyond late childhood. Children normally outgrow knock knees without treatment, unless it is caused by a disease. If surgery is needed, the results are most often good. Complications may include: - Difficulty walking (very rare) - Self-esteem changes related to cosmetic appearance of knock knees - If left untreated, knock knees can lead to early arthritis of the knee Call your provider if you think your child has knock knees. There is no known prevention for normal knock knees. Updated by: Neil K. Kaneshiro, MD, MHA, Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face. Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck. Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse. For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms may include: - Blood coming from the nose - Bruising around the eyes - Difficulty breathing through the nose - Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down) - Pain - Swelling The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. If a nose injury happens: - Try to stay calm. - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat. - Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding. - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose. - To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). - DO NOT try to straighten a broken nose - DO NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury Get medical help right away if: - Bleeding will not stop - Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose - You suspect a blood clot in the septum - You suspect a neck or head injury - The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape - The person is having difficulty breathing Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, or\u00a0riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades. Use seat belts and appropriate car seats when driving. Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "Information only \u2013 not a substitute for professional medical advice.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat\u2019s probably happening  \n\u2022 An \u201cingrown\u201d toenail (onychocryptosis) develops when the edge or corner of the nail curves or is pushed into the surrounding skin.  \n\u2022 The nail fold becomes irritated, swollen, painful and can easily get infected.  \n\u2022 When the problem lingers for months or years, extra skin and scar tissue grow around the nail, making it even harder for the nail to grow out normally.\n\nWhy it keeps coming back  \n1. The nail may be naturally wide, thick or curved.  \n2. Shoes or socks that squeeze the toes keep driving the nail edge inward.  \n3. Cutting the nail too short or rounding the corners lets the skin roll over the edge, trapping the nail.  \n4. Re-growth after a partial \u201cself-trim\u201d often leaves a sharp nail spike under the skin.  \n5. Medical conditions (fungal nail, injury, diabetes, poor circulation) slow healing.\n\nFour years = time to see a foot specialist  \nA problem that has persisted this long almost never clears with home care alone. A podiatrist, family physician or foot/ankle surgeon can:\n\n\u2022 Examine the toe, rule out infection or bone involvement (rarely, X-ray).  \n\u2022 Offer office-based procedures that remove just the troublesome edge or, if needed, the whole nail root on that side. Success rates are 90 %+ and the nail usually still looks normal afterward.  \n\u2022 Prescribe antibiotics if there is active infection.  \n\u2022 Check your circulation and sensation\u2014critical if you have diabetes, vascular disease or neuropathy.\n\nSelf-care until you\u2019re seen  \n(The goals are to reduce pain and keep infection away, not to \u201ccure\u201d a 4-year ingrown toenail.)\n\n1. Warm soaks: 10\u201315 min in warm water with plain Epsom salt, 2\u20133\u00d7/day.  \n2. Keep the toe clean, dry between soaks, and loosely covered with a breathable bandage.  \n3. OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if you have no medical reason to avoid them).  \n4. Shoes: wide toe box, open-toe sandals or barefoot at home; avoid tight socks.  \n5. Do NOT \u201cdig out\u201d the nail or cut a V-notch in the center\u2014these methods are myths and often worsen the problem.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care  \n\u2022 Spreading redness, warmth, pus, or a red streak up the foot/leg.  \n\u2022 Fever or feeling unwell.  \n\u2022 You have diabetes, poor circulation, immune suppression, or neuropathy and notice any break in the skin.\n\nWhat definitive treatment looks like  \n1. Partial nail avulsion + chemical matrixectomy (phenol or sodium hydroxide): the ingrown edge is numbed, removed, and the root on that side is cauterized so it can\u2019t regrow. Walking is usually possible the same day; healing takes 1\u20133 weeks.  \n2. Gutter or splint technique: a thin strip of plastic is slid under the nail edge to lift it away while it grows out. Works best in early cases.  \n3. Total nail removal is rarely needed unless the whole nail is diseased or severely deformed.  \n4. If fungal infection is contributing, oral or topical antifungal medicine may be added.\n\nPrevention once it\u2019s fixed  \n\u2022 Trim straight across; leave the corners visible. File sharp tips instead of cutting deep curves.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t tear or pick at nails.  \n\u2022 Keep nails moderately long\u2014about even with the end of the toe.  \n\u2022 Wear shoes with at least a thumb\u2019s width of space beyond the longest toe; avoid high heels and narrow toe boxes for long periods.  \n\u2022 Manage sweating; keep feet clean and dry.  \n\u2022 Control contributing conditions: treat fungal nail, manage blood sugar, stop smoking to improve circulation.\n\nTake-home message  \nAn ingrown toenail that has lasted four years almost always needs professional attention. Office procedures are quick, done under local anesthetic, and provide permanent relief for most people. Make an appointment with a podiatrist or your primary care clinician as soon as you can, and use the comfort measures above in the meantime.\n\nReliable resources  \n\u2022 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons \u2013 Ingrown Toenail Patient Guide  \n\u2022 Mayo Clinic \u2013 Ingrown Toenails  \n\u2022 UK National Health Service (NHS) \u2013 Ingrown Toenail Treatment\n\nIf you cannot get an appointment soon and notice any signs of infection, go to an urgent care or emergency department.",

The nail may be naturally wide, thick or curved.  \n2. Shoes or socks that squeeze the toes keep driving the nail edge inward.  \n3. Cutting the nail too short or rounding the corners lets the skin roll over the edge, trapping the nail.  \n4. Re-growth after a partial \u201cself-trim\u201d often leaves a sharp nail spike under the skin.  \n5. Medical conditions (fungal nail, injury, diabetes, poor circulation) slow healing.\n\nFour years = time to see a foot specialist  \nA problem that has persisted this long almost never clears with home care alone. A podiatrist, family physician or foot/ankle surgeon can:\n\n\u2022 Examine the toe, rule out infection or bone involvement (rarely, X-ray).  \n\u2022 Offer office-based procedures that remove just the troublesome edge or, if needed, the whole nail root on that side. Success rates are 90 %+ and the nail usually still looks normal afterward.  \n\u2022 Prescribe antibiotics if there is active infection.  \n\u2022 Check your circulation and sensation\u2014critical if you have diabetes, vascular disease or neuropathy.\n\nSelf-care until you\u2019re seen  \n(The goals are to reduce pain and keep infection away, not to \u201ccure\u201d a 4-year ingrown toenail.)\n\n1. Warm soaks: 10\u201315 min in warm water with plain Epsom salt, 2\u20133\u00d7/day.  \n2. Keep the toe clean, dry between soaks, and loosely covered with a breathable bandage.  \n3. OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if you have no medical reason to avoid them).  \n4. Shoes: wide toe box, open-toe sandals or barefoot at home; avoid tight socks.  \n5. Do NOT \u201cdig out\u201d the nail or cut a V-notch in the center\u2014these methods are myths and often worsen the problem.\n\nWhen to seek urgent care  \n\u2022 Spreading redness, warmth, pus, or a red streak up the foot/leg.  \n\u2022 Fever or feeling unwell.  \n\u2022 You have diabetes, poor circulation, immune suppression, or neuropathy and notice any break in the skin.\n\nWhat definitive treatment looks like  \n1. Partial nail avulsion + chemical matrixectomy (phenol or sodium hydroxide): the ingrown edge is numbed, removed, and the root on that side is cauterized so it can\u2019t regrow. Walking is usually possible the same day; healing takes 1\u20133 weeks.  \n2. Gutter or splint technique: a thin strip of plastic is slid under the nail edge to lift it away while it grows out. Works best in early cases.  \n3. Total nail removal is rarely needed unless the whole nail is diseased or severely deformed.  \n4. If fungal infection is contributing, oral or topical antifungal medicine may be added.\n\nPrevention once it\u2019s fixed  \n\u2022 Trim straight across; leave the corners visible. File sharp tips instead of cutting deep curves.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t tear or pick at nails.  \n\u2022 Keep nails moderately long\u2014about even with the end of the toe.  \n\u2022 Wear shoes with at least a thumb\u2019s width of space beyond the longest toe; avoid high heels and narrow toe boxes for long periods.  \n\u2022 Manage sweating; keep feet clean and dry.  \n\u2022 Control contributing conditions: treat fungal nail, manage blood sugar, stop smoking to improve circulation.\n\nTake-home message  \nAn ingrown toenail that has lasted four years almost always needs professional attention. Office procedures are quick, done under local anesthetic, and provide permanent relief for most people. Make an appointment with a podiatrist or your primary care clinician as soon as you can, and use the comfort measures above in the meantime.\n\nReliable resources  \n\u2022 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons \u2013 Ingrown Toenail Patient Guide  \n\u2022 Mayo Clinic \u2013 Ingrown Toenails  \n\u2022 UK National Health Service (NHS) \u2013 Ingrown Toenail Treatment\n\nIf you cannot get an appointment soon and notice any signs of infection, go to an urgent care or emergency department.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nIngrown toenail (Treatment): If you have diabetes, nerve problem in the leg or foot, poor blood circulation to your foot, or an infection around the nail, see a provider right away. Don't try to treat an ingrown nail at home. Otherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home: - Soak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry. - Gently massage over the inflamed skin. - Place a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton or floss with water or antiseptic. When trimming your toenails: - Briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. - Use a clean, sharp trimmer. - Trim toenails straight across the top. Do not taper or round the corners or trim too short.\u00a0 - Do not try to cut out the ingrown portion of the nail yourself. This will only make the problem worse. Consider wearing sandals until the problem goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it does not treat the problem. If this doesn't work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your family doctor, a foot specialist (podiatrist), or a skin specialist (dermatologist). If the ingrown nail doesn't heal or keeps coming back, your provider may remove part of the nail: - Numbing medicine is first injected into the toe. - The ingrown part of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion. - It takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow. If the toe is infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. After the procedure, follow any instructions for helping your nail heal.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

What is distal renal tubular acidosis?  \n\u2022 The kidneys normally keep body fluids \u201cin balance\u201d by getting rid of acids that are produced every day.  \n\u2022 In dRTA (also called Type 1 RTA or acidosis tubular renal distal) the last part of the kidney tubule cannot remove hydrogen ions (acid) properly. Acid builds up in the blood (metabolic acidosis) while the urine stays too alkaline.  \n\u2022 Over time this can lead to poor growth, vomiting, dehydration, low potassium, rickets/osteopenia, kidney stones or nephrocalcinosis (calcium deposits in the kidneys).  \n\u2022 The condition can be inherited (autosomal dominant or recessive) or acquired after certain autoimmune, kidney or drug-related conditions.

The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to\u00a0result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (\"Lewy bodies\") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however,\u00a0medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms. [1] [2] [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delusions - Dementia - Fluctuations in consciousness - Parkinsonism - Visual hallucinations - The exact underlying cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood. The symptoms of the condition are thought to occur when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the regions of the brain involved in thinking, memory and movement. The build-up of these clumps (which are called \"Lewy bodies\") appears to be associated with a loss of certain neurons (nerve cells ) in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters (chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells). The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, sleep, and mood. [4] Although Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically, more than one family member can rarely be affected. Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. For example, copy number variants or changes ( mutations ) in the SNCA gene have been reported in a few affected families. [5] [6] The APOE \u03b54 allele and mutations in the GBA gene have been associated with an increased risk of Lewy body dementia and the APOE \u03b52 allele with a decreased risk. [5] [7] [2] Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited . The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. [4] Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases\u00a0do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). [6] [5] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person\u2019s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.

Persons with Tay-Sachs also have \"cherry-red\" spots in their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0A much rarer form of the disorder, called late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration. The incidence of Tay-Sachs has been particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent., as well as in certain French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns. Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease. Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired. \u00a0A very severe form of Tay-Sachs disease is know as Sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube. Even with the best of care, children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4, from recurring infection.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Use it as a starting point for discussions with your daughter\u2019s medical team. It does not replace advice from your own physicians.\n\n1. What Menkes syndrome is  \n\u2022 Cause: A pathogenic change (mutation) in the ATP7A gene on the X-chromosome prevents the body from transporting and absorbing copper properly.

Confirming or revisiting the diagnosis  \n\u2022 DNA testing of ATP7A is the gold standard.  \n\u2022 Low serum copper and ceruloplasmin (the main copper-carrying protein) support the diagnosis but are not enough on their own.  \n\u2022 Brain MRI often shows characteristic changes, but findings vary.  \nIf your daughter was diagnosed some time ago, you may still wish to speak with a medical geneticist or metabolic specialist about whether additional molecular confirmation or new testing techniques could help guide care or family planning.\n\n4. Treatment and day-to-day management  \nThere is no cure yet, but some interventions can modify the course and improve comfort and quality of life.\n\na. Copper histidinate (Cu-His) injections  \n\u2022 Giving copper within the first 10\u201328 days of life offers the greatest chance of improving neurodevelopmental outcome and survival.

Seizure control  \n\u2022 Standard anticonvulsant medicines are used; dose may be adjusted frequently because of feeding difficulties or malabsorption.  \n\u2022 Vagus nerve stimulation and ketogenic diet have been tried in selected cases.\n\nc. Nutritional and GI support  \n\u2022 Feeding therapy, high-calorie formulas, or gastrostomy (feeding tube) may be required if swallowing becomes unsafe.  \n\u2022 Adequate hydration and management of gastroesophageal reflux help reduce respiratory infections.\n\nd. Physical, occupational, speech, and vision therapies  \n\u2022 Regular therapy sessions can maximize mobility, reduce contractures, and improve communication.\n\ne. Infection prevention  \n\u2022 Vaccinations (including flu and RSV if eligible) and prompt treatment of chest infections are essential because weakened connective tissue can impair airway clearance.\n\nf. Orthopedic and connective-tissue care  \n\u2022 Loose joints can be supported with braces.  \n\u2022 Fractures or vascular complications (aneurysms) need orthopedic or vascular surgical input.\n\ng.

It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system. Additional signs and symptoms include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Children with Menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. Early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood. Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa) is a less severe form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "I\u2019m very sorry your little girl is going through this.  Below is general information on Milroy disease (congenital primary lymphedema) and the treatments that are usually recommended.  Please remember that only your child\u2019s own doctors can make a diagnosis and design a treatment plan for her; use this information to have an informed discussion with them.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n1.  What Milroy disease is\n--------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  It is a genetic form of primary lymphedema.  \n\u2022  Babies are born with lymph-vessels that are too few, too narrow or don\u2019t work well, so lymph fluid builds up, most often in the feet and legs but sometimes in the hands, arms or genitals.  \n\u2022  A change (mutation) in the FLT4 / VEGFR-3 gene is found in many, but not all, children with Milroy disease.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2.  Why early treatment matters\n--------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  Long-standing swelling can stretch the skin, harden the tissues, slow wound-healing and make infections such as cellulitis more likely.  \n\u2022  Controlling swelling early can keep the leg or arm soft, maintain function, and prevent complications later in life.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n3.  Doctors and clinics that usually look after these children\n--------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  Pediatrician (to coordinate care)  \n\u2022  Pediatric dermatologist or vascular/lymphatic anomalies clinic  \n\u2022  Certified lymphedema therapist or physiotherapist  \n\u2022  Geneticist (for genetic testing/counseling)  \nIf you are not already linked with a specialty lymphedema center, ask your pediatrician for a referral.  Many children\u2019s hospitals have a \u201cvascular anomalies\u201d or \u201clymphedema\u201d program.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n4.  How lymphedema is treated\n--------------------------------------------------\nThere is, at present, no medicine that cures Milroy disease, but the swelling can almost always be reduced and kept under control with \u201ccomplete decongestive therapy\u201d (CDT).  In infants and toddlers the steps are adapted to their size and activity level:\n\nA.  Compression  \n   \u2022  Short-stretch multilayer bandaging done by a trained therapist to bring the swelling down (decongestion phase).  \n   \u2022  Once the limb size is improved, custom-made compression garments (stockings, tights, sleeves, or special leggings) worn during the day help keep it down.  \n   \u2022  Many parents use soft night-time quilted garments or a light wrap at night.  \n   \u2022  Garments need to be resized every few months as she grows.\n\nB.  Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD)  \n   \u2022  A gentle, specialized massage that moves fluid toward lymph-rich areas.  \n   \u2022  Parents can be taught a simplified version to use at home once a day or a few times a week.\n\nC.  Exercise and movement  \n   \u2022  Normal crawling, walking and play are excellent; moving the muscles works like a pump under the compression.  \n   \u2022  When she is older: swimming, cycling and gentle gymnastics are good options.\n\nD.  Skin care  \n   \u2022  Wash, rinse and dry skin folds daily; moisturize with plain, scent-free cream.  \n   \u2022  Treat cuts, insect bites or rashes promptly to prevent infection.  \n   \u2022  Watch for signs of cellulitis (redness, heat, pain, sudden swelling, fever) and seek urgent medical care\u2014antibiotics may be needed.\n\nE.  Weight management & nutrition  \n   \u2022  Keeping weight in a healthy range lessens the load on the lymph system.  \n   \u2022  No special diet is required, just balanced age-appropriate nutrition.\n\nF.  Infections and vaccines  \n   \u2022  Routine childhood vaccinations can be given\u2014usually in an unaffected limb if possible.  \n   \u2022  If cellulitis occurs repeatedly, some specialists prescribe low-dose preventive antibiotics.\n\nG.

Management is typically conservative and usually successful in most people. [3] Management of lymphedema should be guided by a lymphedema therapist. Some improvement is usually possible with the use of properly fitted compression hosiery or bandaging and well fitting, supportive shoes. Good skin care is essential. These measures may improve the cosmetic appearance of the affected areas, decrease their size, and reduce the risk of complications. [2] Decongestive physiotherapy , which combines compression bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage (a specialized massage technique), exercise, breathing exercises, dietary measures and skin care, has become the standard of care for primary lymphedema. [3] People with recurrent cellulitis may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics . [2] [3] Surgical intervention is considered a last option when other medical management fails. [3] When possible, people with Milroy disease should avoid: wounds to swollen areas (because of their reduced resistance to infection) long periods of immobility prolonged standing elevation of the affected limb certain medications (particularly calcium channel-blocking drugs that can cause increased leg swelling in some people)[2] Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Fewer than 1,000 living people are documented in the medical literature, so information is scattered, but enough adults have now been followed to give a reasonable picture of life-long issues, including child-bearing.\n\n1. Why it happens  \n\u2022 Inheritance: autosomal-recessive.  A person must receive a non-working copy of either the EVC or EVC2 gene from each parent to be affected.  \n\u2022 If you have EVC: every child you conceive will receive one non-working copy from you.  Unless your partner is also a carrier, none of your children will have the syndrome itself, although they will all be carriers.  If your partner is a carrier, each pregnancy faces the typical recessive ratios (25 % affected, 50 % carrier, 25 % unaffected/non-carrier).  \n\u2022 Carrier frequency is very low in the general population but can be high in certain isolated communities (for example, Old-Order Amish, certain Arab and Ashkenazi villages).\n\n2. Typical features through life  \n\u2022 At birth/childhood: short limbs and stature (adult height \ufffd\ufffd100\u2013140 cm), narrow chest, extra fingers or toes (post-axial polydactyly), small or absent nails, multiple oral frenula and tooth abnormalities.  \n\u2022 Heart: 50\u201360 % have a congenital heart defect, most often a common atrio-ventricular canal; survival is good when the defect is mild or surgically repaired.  \n\u2022 Lungs: the short, narrow rib cage can predispose to respiratory infections, particularly in early life.  \n\u2022 Adulthood: persistent short stature, possible joint pain/early osteoarthritis, dental work, occasional restrictive-lung symptoms, psychosocial and employment issues typical of other short-stature conditions.\n\n3. Sexual development, fertility and having children  \n\u2022 Puberty: normal timing and hormonal profiles are the rule.  Male and female secondary sexual characteristics develop normally.  \n\u2022 Fertility: there is no evidence of impaired fertility in either sex due to EVC itself.  Sperm counts, ovulation and endocrine function have been normal in the few adults analysed.  \n\u2022 Published adult cases:   \n  \u2013 Multiple Amish adults (men and women) with genetically confirmed EVC have fathered or given birth to several children.  \n  \u2013 Bodur et al., 2015, reported a Turkish woman with EVC who carried two pregnancies to term; both infants were carriers only.  \n  \u2013 Al-Kindi et al., 2020, reviewed 27 adult patients (14 female) worldwide; 8 women had been pregnant, most delivered by Caesarean section because of small pelvic capacity.  \n\u2022 Obstetric considerations for women  \n  \u2013 Short stature and a relatively narrow pelvis raise the risk of cephalo-pelvic disproportion; most obstetric teams plan an elective C-section.  \n  \u2013 Cardiac status must be assessed pre-pregnancy; significant residual heart disease may require specialist maternal-fetal care or surgery before conception.  \n  \u2013 Respiratory reserve: because the thorax is small, the normal late-pregnancy drop in lung capacity can cause breathlessness; pulmonary follow-up is recommended.  \n  \u2013 Epidural/spinal anaesthesia is feasible but the anaesthetist should be aware of potential spine anomalies.  \n\u2022 Men\u2019s health issues  \n  \u2013 No consistent urogenital or erectile problems are linked to EVC.  \n  \u2013 Stature or limb differences can complicate usual positioning during fertility evaluation, but actual sperm function is normal in reported cases.\n\n4. Living with EVC as an adult  \n\u2022 Orthopaedics: monitoring for hip dysplasia, knee valgus and early osteoarthritis; corrective surgery may be helpful.  \n\u2022 Dentistry: lifelong dental follow-up for enamel defects and missing teeth.  \n\u2022 Cardiology: periodic echo if a congenital defect is present or was repaired.  \n\u2022 Psychosocial: access to peer groups (see resources below) and occupational therapy for workplace adaptations.\n\n5. Current research and registries  \n\u2022 Gene discovery: 2000 (EVC and EVC2 genes, chromosome 4p16).  \n\u2022 Ciliary biology: EVC/EVC2 proteins sit in the basal body of the primary cilium; the syndrome is classed as a \u201cciliopathy.\u201d  Work in zebrafish and mouse models is clarifying how the defect leads to short bones and heart malformations.  \n\u2022 Natural-history studies: NIH-funded skeletal-dysplasia registries (USA), the European Skeletal Dysplasia Network, and individual country registries (e.g., Germany\u2019s).

The features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome overlap with those of another, milder condition called Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Like Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, Weyers acrofacial dysostosis involves tooth and nail abnormalities, although affected individuals have less pronounced short stature and typically do not have heart defects. The two conditions are caused by mutations in the same genes.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

This damage leads to the release of too much protein in the urine. The most common cause in children is minimal change disease. Membranous glomerulonephritis is the most common cause in adults.In both diseases, the glomeruli in the kidneys are damaged. Glomeruli are the structures that help filter wastes and fluids. This condition can also occur from: - Cancer - Diseases such as diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, and amyloidosis - Genetic disorders - Immune disorders - Infections (such as strep throat, hepatitis, or mononucleosis) - Use of certain drugs It can occur with kidney disorders such as: - Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis - Glomerulonephritis - Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis Nephrotic syndrome can affect all age groups. In children, it is most common between ages 2 and 6.

    "predicted_text": "How would a person\u2014or the parent of a child\u2014realize that night-blindness is present from birth rather than caused later by injury, nutritional problems, or another eye disease?  The key points are:\n\n1. Typical timing  \n\u2022 \u201cCongenital\u201d means the problem is present at birth, although it may not be recognized until the first situations that require vision in dim light (evening play, camping, school sleep-overs, etc.).  \n\u2022 Most families notice something is wrong in early childhood (ages 2-6). A child with congenital night blindness usually shows no difficulty in normal daylight; the first signs appear only when the lights are low.\n\n2. Day-to-day clues  \n\u2022 The child (or adult) cannot see, or sees very poorly, at dusk, in movie theaters, during power outages, or in poorly lit classrooms.  \n\u2022 Hesitation, clinging to a parent, or bumping into furniture when lights are turned off.  \n\u2022 Reluctance to play hide-and-seek in dim rooms, or fear of going outside at night when siblings and friends have no problem.  \n\u2022 Needing a flashlight or phone light to move around even when others don\u2019t.  \n\u2022 In adults, lifelong statements such as \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to see in the dark,\u201d predating any other eye trouble.\n\n3. What is (and is not) seen on routine eye exams  \n\u2022 Daylight (photopic) visual acuity is usually normal or near-normal.  \n\u2022 The front of the eye and the retina often look normal with a basic exam, so standard school vision screenings may miss the condition.  \n\u2022 Myopia (nearsightedness), nystagmus (eye wobble), or strabismus (eye turn) may coexist in some inherited forms but are not always present.\n\n4. Confirming the diagnosis  \nOnly an eye-care professional can tell you for sure. Diagnosis may include:  \n\u2022 Dark-adaptation testing: measures how quickly and how well the eye adjusts to the dark.  \n\u2022 Electroretinography (ERG): records the electrical response of the retina to light and can pinpoint rod-cell malfunction typical of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB).  \n\u2022 Genetic testing: many cases are linked to mutations in genes such as NYX, CACNA1F, GRM6, etc.  \n\u2022 Full retinal examination to rule out progressive disorders (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa) that can also start with night-vision problems but worsen over time.\n\n5. Why the timing matters  \n\u2022 \u201cCongenital stationary night blindness\u201d is usually non-progressive\u2014once diagnosed, the dim-light problem remains but daytime vision stays stable.  \n\u2022 Progressive conditions that also start with night-blindness (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa or vitamin A deficiency) get worse over years. An eye-care professional distinguishes between the two.\n\n6. What to do if you suspect it  \n\u2022 Keep a log of situations where you or your child cannot see in low light.  \n\u2022 Schedule a comprehensive dilated eye exam with an ophthalmologist (ideally one who specializes in retinal or inherited eye diseases).  \n\u2022 Mention any family history of similar problems or of consanguinity (parents related by blood), as this can guide testing.  \n\u2022 Ask whether an ERG or genetic panel is appropriate.  \n\u2022 Discuss practical steps: carrying a small flashlight, installing night-lights, higher contrast markings on stairs, and education accommodations if needed.\n\nBottom line  \nYou \u201cknow\u201d you have congenital night blindness when difficulty seeing in low-light settings has been present since the earliest occasions it could be tested, other parts of vision are relatively normal, and an eye-care professional confirms non-progressive rod dysfunction (often via ERG or genetic testing). If you see these signs, book an ophthalmology appointment; only formal testing can separate congenital stationary night blindness from progressive or treatable causes of poor night vision.",

        "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nWhen and how do you know when you have congenital night blindness?\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHow would a person\u2014or the parent of a child\u2014realize that night-blindness is present from birth rather than caused later by injury, nutritional problems, or another eye disease?  The key points are:\n\n1. Typical timing  \n\u2022 \u201cCongenital\u201d means the problem is present at birth, although it may not be recognized until the first situations that require vision in dim light (evening play, camping, school sleep-overs, etc.).  \n\u2022 Most families notice something is wrong in early childhood (ages 2-6). A child with congenital night blindness usually shows no difficulty in normal daylight; the first signs appear only when the lights are low.\n\n2. Day-to-day clues  \n\u2022 The child (or adult) cannot see, or sees very poorly, at dusk, in movie theaters, during power outages, or in poorly lit classrooms.  \n\u2022 Hesitation, clinging to a parent, or bumping into furniture when lights are turned off.  \n\u2022 Reluctance to play hide-and-seek in dim rooms, or fear of going outside at night when siblings and friends have no problem.  \n\u2022 Needing a flashlight or phone light to move around even when others don\u2019t.  \n\u2022 In adults, lifelong statements such as \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to see in the dark,\u201d predating any other eye trouble.\n\n3. What is (and is not) seen on routine eye exams  \n\u2022 Daylight (photopic) visual acuity is usually normal or near-normal.  \n\u2022 The front of the eye and the retina often look normal with a basic exam, so standard school vision screenings may miss the condition.  \n\u2022 Myopia (nearsightedness), nystagmus (eye wobble), or strabismus (eye turn) may coexist in some inherited forms but are not always present.\n\n4. Confirming the diagnosis  \nOnly an eye-care professional can tell you for sure. Diagnosis may include:  \n\u2022 Dark-adaptation testing: measures how quickly and how well the eye adjusts to the dark.  \n\u2022 Electroretinography (ERG): records the electrical response of the retina to light and can pinpoint rod-cell malfunction typical of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB).  \n\u2022 Genetic testing: many cases are linked to mutations in genes such as NYX, CACNA1F, GRM6, etc.  \n\u2022 Full retinal examination to rule out progressive disorders (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa) that can also start with night-vision problems but worsen over time.\n\n5. Why the timing matters  \n\u2022 \u201cCongenital stationary night blindness\u201d is usually non-progressive\u2014once diagnosed, the dim-light problem remains but daytime vision stays stable.  \n\u2022 Progressive conditions that also start with night-blindness (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa or vitamin A deficiency) get worse over years. An eye-care professional distinguishes between the two.\n\n6. What to do if you suspect it  \n\u2022 Keep a log of situations where you or your child cannot see in low light.  \n\u2022 Schedule a comprehensive dilated eye exam with an ophthalmologist (ideally one who specializes in retinal or inherited eye diseases).  \n\u2022 Mention any family history of similar problems or of consanguinity (parents related by blood), as this can guide testing.  \n\u2022 Ask whether an ERG or genetic panel is appropriate.  \n\u2022 Discuss practical steps: carrying a small flashlight, installing night-lights, higher contrast markings on stairs, and education accommodations if needed.\n\nBottom line  \nYou \u201cknow\u201d you have congenital night blindness when difficulty seeing in low-light settings has been present since the earliest occasions it could be tested, other parts of vision are relatively normal, and an eye-care professional confirms non-progressive rod dysfunction (often via ERG or genetic testing). If you see these signs, book an ophthalmology appointment; only formal testing can separate congenital stationary night blindness from progressive or treatable causes of poor night vision.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nautosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness: Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous ingredients include: - Digitoxigenin - Neriin - Oleandrin - Oleondroside Note: This list may not include all poisonous ingredients. The poisonous substances are found in all parts of the oleander plant: - Flowers - Leaves - Stems - Twigs Oleander poisoning can affect many parts of the body. HEART AND BLOOD - Irregular or slow heartbeat - Low blood pressure - Weakness EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROAT - Blurred vision - Vision disturbances, including halos STOMACH AND INTESTINES - Diarrhea - Loss of appetite - Nausea and vomiting - Stomach pain NERVOUS SYSTEM - Confusion - Death - Depression - Disorientation - Dizziness - Drowsiness - Fainting - Headache - Lethargy SKIN - Hives - Rash Note: Depression, loss of appetite, and halos are most often seen in chronic overdose cases. Seek immediate medical help. DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider. Get the following information: - Person's age, weight, and condition - Name and part of the plant swallowed, if known - Time it was swallowed - Amount swallowed Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does not need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive: - Activated charcoal - Blood and urine tests - Breathing support - Chest x-ray - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) - Fluids through a vein (IV) - Medicines to treat symptoms including an antidote to reverse the effects of the poison - Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage) How well you do depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster you get medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Symptoms last for 1 to 3 days and may require a hospital stay. Death is unlikely. DO NOT touch or eat any plant with which you are not familiar. Wash your hands after working in the garden or walking in the woods.

The optic nerve carries images of what the eye sees to the brain. There are many causes of optic atrophy. The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma. Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include: - Brain tumor - Cranial arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis) - Multiple sclerosis - Stroke There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults. Optic nerve atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded. Over time, the pupil will be less able to react to light, and eventually,\u00a0its ability to react to light may be lost. The health care provider will do a complete eye exam to look for the condition. The exam will include tests of: - Color vision - Pupil light reflex - Tonometry - Visual acuity You may also need a complete physical exam and other tests. Damage from optic nerve atrophy cannot be reversed. The underlying disease must be found and treated. Otherwise, vision loss will continue. Rarely, conditions that lead to optic atrophy may be treatable. Vision lost to optic nerve atrophy cannot be recovered. It is very important to protect the other eye. People with this condition need to be checked regularly by an eye doctor with experience in nerve-related conditions. Tell your doctor right away about any change in vision. Many causes of optic nerve atrophy cannot be prevented. Prevention steps include: - Older adults should have their provider carefully manage their blood pressure. - Use standard safety precautions to prevent injuries to the face. Most facial injuries are the result of car accidents. Wearing seat belts may help prevent these injuries. - Schedule a routine annual eye exam to check for glaucoma. - Never drink home-brewed alcohol and forms of alcohol that are not intended for drinking. Methanol, which is found in home-brewed alcohol, can cause optic nerve atrophy in both eyes. Updated by: Franklin W. Lusby, MD, ophthalmologist, Lusby Vision Institute, La Jolla, CA.

In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin - Eyes - Lungs - Heart - Kidneys - Salivary glands - Nerve tissue - Bone marrow - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium - the lining of the membranes that surround your joints. The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch. Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment. Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors - such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria - that may trigger the disease. Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include: - Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis. - Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60. - Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Blood tests People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. Imaging tests Your doctor may recommend X-rays to help track the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in your joints over time. MRI and ultrasound tests can help your doctor judge the severity of the disease in your body. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But recent discoveries indicate that remission of symptoms is more likely when treatment begins early with strong medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Medications The types of medications recommended by your doctor will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how long you've had rheumatoid arthritis. - NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects may include ringing in your ears, stomach irritation, heart problems, and liver and kidney damage. - Steroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes. Doctors often prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve acute symptoms, with the goal of gradually tapering off the medication. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. Common DMARDs include methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo), leflunomide (Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects vary but may include liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infections. - Biologic agents. Also known as biologic response modifiers, this newer class of DMARDs includes abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan), tocilizumab (Actemra) and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). These drugs can target parts of the immune system that trigger inflammation that causes joint and tissue damage. These types of drugs also increase the risk of infections. Biologic DMARDs are usually most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD, such as methotrexate. Therapy Your doctor may send you to a physical or occupational therapist who can teach you exercises to help keep your joints flexible. The therapist may also suggest new ways to do daily tasks, which will be easier on your joints. For example, if your fingers are sore, you may want to pick up an object using your forearms. Assistive devices can make it easier to avoid stressing your painful joints. For instance, a kitchen knife equipped with a saw handle helps protect your finger and wrist joints. Certain tools, such as buttonhooks, can make it easier to get dressed. Catalogs and medical supply stores are good places to look for ideas. Surgery If medications fail to prevent or slow joint damage, you and your doctor may consider surgery to repair damaged joints. Surgery may help restore your ability to use your joint. It can also reduce pain and correct deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis surgery may involve one or more of the following procedures: - Synovectomy. Surgery to remove the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint). Synovectomy can be performed on knees, elbows, wrists, fingers and hips. - Tendon repair. Inflammation and joint damage may cause tendons around your joint to loosen or rupture. Your surgeon may be able to repair the tendons around your joint. - Joint fusion. Surgically fusing a joint may be recommended to stabilize or realign a joint and for pain relief when a joint replacement isn't an option. - Total joint replacement. During joint replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the damaged parts of your joint and inserts a prosthesis made of metal and plastic. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding, infection and pain. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. You can take steps to care for your body if you have rheumatoid arthritis. These self-care measures, when used along with your rheumatoid arthritis medications, can help you manage your signs and symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, and it can help fight fatigue you might feel. Check with your doctor before you start exercising. If you're just getting started, begin by taking a walk. Try swimming or gentle water aerobics. Avoid exercising tender, injured or severely inflamed joints. - Apply heat or cold. Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull the sensation of pain. Cold also has a numbing effect and decreases muscle spasms. - Relax. Find ways to cope with pain by reducing stress in your life. Techniques such as guided imagery, distraction and muscle relaxation can all be used to control pain. Some common complementary and alternative treatments that have shown promise for rheumatoid arthritis include: - Fish oil. Some preliminary studies have found that fish oil supplements may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain and stiffness. Side effects can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. Fish oil can interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Plant oils. The seeds of evening primrose, borage and black currant contain a type of fatty acid that may help with rheumatoid arthritis pain and morning stiffness. Side effects may include nausea, diarrhea and gas. Some plant oils can cause liver damage or interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Tai chi. This movement therapy involves gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use tai chi to relieve stress in their lives. Small studies have found that tai chi may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, tai chi is safe. But don't do any moves that cause pain.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Below is a plain-language overview of what polymicrogyria (PMG) means, what it usually does \u2014 and, just as important, what it does NOT do.\n\n1.  What polymicrogyria is  \n   \u2022 During pregnancy the cerebral cortex folds abnormally, creating many small, shallow gyri (\u201cpolymicro-gyria\u201d).  \n   \u2022 That \u201cmis-folding\u201d is a structural change; it is present at birth and does not progress or reverse.  \n   \u2022 Think of it like the wiring in a house that was installed differently while the house was being built; once the walls go up, the wiring layout stays the same.\n\n2.  Does the brain ever \u201cgrow out of it\u201d?  \n   \u2022 The abnormal folds themselves do not straighten out or turn into a typical pattern later on.  \n   \u2022 HOWEVER, the brain is remarkably plastic, especially in the first few years of life.  Even though the physical structure won\u2019t change, other parts of the brain can learn to take over or support functions.  \n   \u2022 So children with milder or localized PMG can continue to gain new skills.  Improvement is expected, but it happens through compensation and therapy, not by the cortex \u201cbecoming normal.\u201d\n\n3.  Why some children are far more affected than others  \n   \u2022 The outcome depends on:  \n     \u2013 How much cortex is involved (focal vs. widespread).  \n     \u2013 Which areas are involved (motor strip, language areas, etc.).  \n     \u2013 Whether other brain problems or genetic syndromes are present.  \n   \u2022 Because of that, severity ranges from minimal motor delay all the way to severe physical and intellectual disability plus epilepsy.\n\n4.  Typical developmental picture  \n   \u2022 Motor: low muscle tone (hypotonia), late sitting/crawling/walking, sometimes spasticity.  \n   \u2022 Speech/language: may be delayed, but many children eventually speak.  \n   \u2022 Seizures: 50\u201390 % develop some form of epilepsy, often controllable with medication.  \n   \u2022 Learning/intellect: from normal to moderate impairment; again it depends on extent/location.\n\n5.  What helps  \n   \u2022 Early-intervention physical, occupational and speech therapy are the best-proven ways to maximize skills.  \n   \u2022 Regular neurologic follow-up to watch for seizures or tight/stiff muscles.  \n   \u2022 If epilepsy appears, aggressive seizure control helps brain development.  \n   \u2022 Vision and hearing testing, because subtle deficits worsen motor and language delays if missed.\n\n6.  Practical outlook for your son (based on what you\u2019ve shared)  \n   \u2022 Not sitting at 16 months is a delay, but gaining hand use and interest in moving are good signs.  \n   \u2022 Many children with similar starts do learn to sit, crawl and even walk, usually on a later timetable.  \n   \u2022 Language may follow the same \u201cdelayed but progressing\u201d pattern.  \n   \u2022 Expect gradual progress rather than suddenly \u201ccatching up overnight.\u201d\n\n7.  Questions to ask your child\u2019s care team  \n   \u2022 Exactly which brain regions show PMG on his MRI?  \n   \u2022 Any sign of other malformations (corpus callosum, brainstem, etc.)?  \n   \u2022 Has a genetic test or infection screen been done to look for an underlying cause?  \n   \u2022 What early-intervention services can start now (PT, OT, speech)?  \n   \u2022 How will you monitor for seizures, and what should I watch for at home?\n\n8.  Red-flag symptoms that need urgent review  \n   \u2022 Any staring spells, sudden stiffening, twitching or loss of awareness.  \n   \u2022 Regression (loss of skills he already had).  \n   \u2022 Feeding trouble or breathing changes.  \n   \u2022 Rapid increase in head size or sudden change in muscle tone.\n\n9.  Where to find support  \n   \u2022 PMG Family Support/PMG Awareness Organization (online community, parent guides).  \n   \u2022 Child Neurology Foundation, United Cerebral Palsy, local Early Intervention program.  \n   \u2022 Meeting other families often helps set realistic but hopeful expectations.\n\nKey point in one sentence: The abnormal folds won\u2019t \u201cgrow back to normal,\u201d but the condition is not degenerative, and with therapy and good medical care many children gain new motor, language and learning skills over time.",

Typical developmental picture  \n   \u2022 Motor: low muscle tone (hypotonia), late sitting/crawling/walking, sometimes spasticity.  \n   \u2022 Speech/language: may be delayed, but many children eventually speak.  \n   \u2022 Seizures: 50\u201390 % develop some form of epilepsy, often controllable with medication.  \n   \u2022 Learning/intellect: from normal to moderate impairment; again it depends on extent/location.\n\n5.  What helps  \n   \u2022 Early-intervention physical, occupational and speech therapy are the best-proven ways to maximize skills.  \n   \u2022 Regular neurologic follow-up to watch for seizures or tight/stiff muscles.  \n   \u2022 If epilepsy appears, aggressive seizure control helps brain development.  \n   \u2022 Vision and hearing testing, because subtle deficits worsen motor and language delays if missed.\n\n6.  Practical outlook for your son (based on what you\u2019ve shared)  \n   \u2022 Not sitting at 16 months is a delay, but gaining hand use and interest in moving are good signs.  \n   \u2022 Many children with similar starts do learn to sit, crawl and even walk, usually on a later timetable.  \n   \u2022 Language may follow the same \u201cdelayed but progressing\u201d pattern.  \n   \u2022 Expect gradual progress rather than suddenly \u201ccatching up overnight.\u201d\n\n7.  Questions to ask your child\u2019s care team  \n   \u2022 Exactly which brain regions show PMG on his MRI?  \n   \u2022 Any sign of other malformations (corpus callosum, brainstem, etc.)?  \n   \u2022 Has a genetic test or infection screen been done to look for an underlying cause?  \n   \u2022 What early-intervention services can start now (PT, OT, speech)?  \n   \u2022 How will you monitor for seizures, and what should I watch for at home?\n\n8.  Red-flag symptoms that need urgent review  \n   \u2022 Any staring spells, sudden stiffening, twitching or loss of awareness.  \n   \u2022 Regression (loss of skills he already had).  \n   \u2022 Feeding trouble or breathing changes.  \n   \u2022 Rapid increase in head size or sudden change in muscle tone.\n\n9.  Where to find support  \n   \u2022 PMG Family Support/PMG Awareness Organization (online community, parent guides).  \n   \u2022 Child Neurology Foundation, United Cerebral Palsy, local Early Intervention program.  \n   \u2022 Meeting other families often helps set realistic but hopeful expectations.\n\nKey point in one sentence: The abnormal folds won\u2019t \u201cgrow back to normal,\u201d but the condition is not degenerative, and with therapy and good medical care many children gain new motor, language and learning skills over time.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nPolymicrogyria: Polymicrogyria is a condition characterized by abnormal development of the brain before birth. Specifically, the surface of the brain develops too many folds which are unusually small. The signs and symptoms associated with the condition vary based on how much of the brain and which areas of the brain are affected; however, affected people may experience recurrent seizures ( epilepsy ); delayed development; crossed eyes ; problems with speech and swallowing; and muscle weakness or paralysis. Bilateral forms (affecting both sides of the brain) tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Polymicrogyria can result from both genetic and environmental causes. It may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome . Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] A wide variety of symptoms may be observed in people with polymicrogyria, depending on the areas of the brain implicated and whether or not it is part of a larger syndrome . Signs and symptoms may include: [3] [4] Developmental delay Crossed eyes Epilepsy Paralysis of the face, throat, and tongue Difficulty with speech and swallowing Drooling The diagnosis of polymicrogyria is made by imaging brain structures using\u00a0 MRI . Typical findings include areas of the\u00a0 cerebral cortex\u00a0with a complex set of small gyri that appear fused to each other and separated by shallow sulci. These findings may be isolated to one side of the brain (unilateral) or may involve both sides of the brain (bilateral). [3] [4] The resources below provide information about treatment options for this condition. If you have questions about which treatment is right for you, talk to your healthcare professional.

Start pregnancy in the best possible health\n   \u2022 Achieve a healthy body-mass index (BMI) before conception; obesity roughly doubles the risk.\n   \u2022 Bring chronic illnesses\u2014especially high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease and autoimmune disorders\u2014under the best possible control prior to conception.\n   \u2022 Stop smoking and limit alcohol; both independently raise the risk of placental problems.\n\n2.

Low-dose aspirin, when recommended\n   \u2022 Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that 81 mg (sometimes 75\u2013150 mg) aspirin taken once daily, started between 12\u201316 weeks and continued to 36 weeks, reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by 10\u201325 % and the risk of severe/early-onset disease even more.\n   \u2022 It is now recommended for women at high risk (previous pre-eclampsia, multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, type 1 or 2 diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disease) or with more than one \u201cmoderate\u201d risk factor (first pregnancy, obesity, age \u226535, family history, Black race).\n\n4. Adequate calcium intake\n   \u2022 In populations where baseline calcium intake is low (<600 mg/day), calcium supplementation (1\u20131.5 g/day, divided doses) beginning before 20 weeks lowers the risk of pre-eclampsia by about one-third.\n   \u2022 If you already get 1,000 mg/day of calcium through food, extra supplementation has little added value\u2014but making sure you reach that level is reasonable and safe.\n\n5. Manage weight gain and stay active\n   \u2022 Excessive gestational weight gain, especially early in pregnancy, increases risk. Follow the weight-gain targets set for your prepregnancy BMI.\n   \u2022 Moderate exercise (e.g., 30 min brisk walking most days) is associated with a modest reduction in pre-eclampsia and generally improves blood-pressure control and glucose levels.\n\n6. Control blood pressure throughout pregnancy\n   \u2022 If you have chronic hypertension, use pregnancy-safe antihypertensives (labetalol, nifedipine, methyldopa) to keep BP <135/85 mm Hg (individual targets vary).\n   \u2022 Home BP monitoring between office visits can pick up early rises.\n\n7. Treat or screen for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) if suspected\n   \u2022 OSA has been linked to higher pre-eclampsia rates.

How does leukemia affect your body?\n   \u2022 The abnormal white blood cells (\u201cblasts\u201d) multiply in the bone marrow and crowd out normal cells.  \n   \u2022 With fewer red cells \u2192 anemia \u2192 fatigue, shortness of breath.  \n   \u2022 With fewer platelets \u2192 easy bruising or bleeding.  \n   \u2022 With abnormal or too few functioning white cells \u2192 frequent or severe infections.  \n   \u2022 The leukemic cells can accumulate in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gums, skin, or brain, causing swelling or pain.\n\n4. Is leukemia inherited?\n   \u2022 The disease itself is almost never directly inherited.  \n   \u2022 However, certain inherited syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Li-Fraumeni) raise the risk.  \n   \u2022 Very rarely more than one person in a family gets leukemia, but that is unusual.\n\n5. What is \u201cadvanced\u201d leukemia?\n   \u2022 In the acute leukemias (ALL, AML): disease that has returned after treatment (relapsed) or that did not respond in the first place (refractory).  \n   \u2022 In chronic leukemias (CLL, CML): a late \u201cblast\u201d phase when the disease begins to behave like an acute leukemia, or any stage where the leukemic burden is very high and organs are failing.\n\n6. How long can someone with leukemia expect to live?\n   This ranges from weeks (if an aggressive leukemia is untreated) to decades (for CML on modern drugs or cured ALL). Median survival figures:\n   \u2022 Untreated acute leukemia: weeks\u2013months.  \n   \u2022 AML after modern therapy: 3\u20135 year survival about 30\u201340 % in adults.  \n   \u2022 Childhood ALL: > 90 % 5-year survival, many cured for life.  \n   \u2022 CML on TKIs: > 90 % 10-year survival; many live normal lifespans.  \n   Remember: statistics describe groups, not individuals.\n\n7. Can you tell if you have leukemia?\n   \u2022 Early symptoms are vague\u2014fatigue, fevers, night sweats, bruising, weight loss.  \n   \u2022 The only way to know for sure is a blood count (CBC) and often a bone-marrow test ordered by a doctor.  \n   \u2022 Because early changes can be subtle, most people are diagnosed only after a routine blood test or when symptoms push them to seek care.\n\n8. What treatments are used?\n   \u2022 Chemotherapy (given IV or pills) remains the backbone for most acute leukemias.  \n   \u2022 Targeted therapy: tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, dasatinib, etc., for CML; FLT3, IDH, or BCL-2 inhibitors for some AMLs.  \n   \u2022 Immunotherapy/biologics: monoclonal antibodies (e.g., blinatumomab), CAR-T cell therapy (esp. in relapsed ALL), checkpoint inhibitors in certain cases.  \n   \u2022 Stem-cell (bone-marrow) transplant: used when risk of relapse is high or when first-line treatment fails.  \n   \u2022 Radiation therapy is occasionally used for specific sites (e.g., brain or spleen) or before transplant.  \n   \u2022 Supportive care: antibiotics, blood transfusions, growth factors, antivirals, antif",

Keep in mind that \u201cleukemia\u201d is really a family of different blood cancers, so every answer is a generalization; the exact details depend on the specific type (ALL, AML, CLL, CML, etc.) and on the individual patient.\n\n1. What causes leukemia?\n   \u2022 Leukemia starts when a single blood-forming cell in the bone marrow acquires a DNA change (mutation) that lets it grow out of control.  \n   \u2022 Most of the time we do not know why that mutation happened.  \n   \u2022 Known risk factors include: high-dose radiation, certain industrial chemicals (e.g., benzene), previous chemotherapy or radiation for another cancer, smoking, and some rare genetic conditions such as Down syndrome, Li-Fraumeni, and Fanconi anemia.  \n   \u2022 For the great majority of patients it is NOT the result of something they did, and most cases are not inherited.\n\n2.

Your doctor determines your leukemia treatment options based on your age and overall health, the type of leukemia you have, and whether it has spread to other parts of your body, including the central nervous system. Common treatments used to fight leukemia include: - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells. Depending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein. - Biological therapy. Biological therapy works by using treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack leukemia cells. - Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific vulnerabilities within your cancer cells. For example, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) stops the action of a protein within the leukemia cells of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. This can help control the disease. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body. You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a stem cell transplant. - Stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. Before a stem cell transplant, you receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help to rebuild your bone marrow. You may receive stem cells from a donor, or in some cases you may be able to use your own stem cells. A stem cell transplant is very similar to a bone marrow transplant.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Early treatment prevents joint damage\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nPsoriasis (Treatment): The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection. Three treatment options are available: - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments. - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments. - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis. TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL) Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include: - Cortisone creams and ointments - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid) - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) - Moisturizers - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used. Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: - Adalimumab (Humira) - Etanercept (Enbrel) - Infliximab (Remicade) - Ustekinumab (Stelara) - Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - Apremilast (Otezla) - Ixekizumab (Taltz) PHOTOTHERAPY Some people may choose to have phototherapy: - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light. - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light. OTHER TREATMENTS If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. HOME CARE Following these tips at home may help: - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (240 mL) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water. - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned. - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood. - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. One of the most promising MS research areas involves naturally occurring antiviral proteins known as interferons. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe. In addition, there are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models. In 2001, the National Academies/Institute of Medicine, a Federal technical and scientific advisory agency, prepared a strategic review of MS research.

Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment. Sometimes your doctor may recommend 1 treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be 2 or more treatments that could be good for you. Factors you and your doctor must think about include: - Your age and other medical problems you may have - Side effects that occur with each type of treatment - How much the prostate cancer has spread - Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread - Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result Ask your doctor to explain these things following about your treatment choices: - Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread? - How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure. Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone. External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland: - Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated. - Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless. - Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital. - Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. Side effects may include: - Appetite loss - Diarrhea - Erection problems - Fatigue - Rectal burning or injury - Skin reactions - Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well. Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland. - A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them. - The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include: - Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum - Red-brown urine or semen - Impotence - Incontinence - Urinary retention - Diarrhea Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body's immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

Prognosis  \n\u2022 In children, rubella is almost always self-limited and leaves lifelong immunity.  \n\u2022 Once he is past the contagious window and feeling better, there are usually no long-term effects.\n\nBottom line  \nYou do not need to panic about your grandson\u2019s health, but you should: (1) follow his doctor\u2019s instructions, (2) keep him away from pregnant women for at least a week after the rash disappears, and (3) make sure everyone\u2019s vaccinations are up to date so the virus does not spread further.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nRubella (Lifestyle and home remedies): In rare instances when a child or adult is infected with rubella, simple self-care measures are required: - Rest in bed as necessary. - Take acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to relieve discomfort from fever and aches. - Tell friends, family and co-workers - especially pregnant women - about your diagnosis if they may have been exposed to the disease. - Avoid people who have conditions that cause deficient or suppressed immune systems. - Tell your child's school or child care provider that your child has rubella.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, and potential benefits for you and your baby. It's important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist. Cesarean birth Many babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby. Surgery after birth Meningocele involves surgery to put the meninges back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Because the spinal cord develops normally in babies with meningocele, these membranes often can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that's associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby's brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord. Treatment for complications In babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications - such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems or hydrocephalus - typically begins soon after birth. Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life, but less often as children grow. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. - For children, a specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida is the best choice. - Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a ventricular shunt - a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen. This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be used, but candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain. - Treatment and management of other complications. To help with functioning, special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may be needed. Whatever the issue - orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems, or others - most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life. Ongoing care Children with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation. Their primary care doctors follow growth, the need for immunizations and general medical issues. They coordinate your child's medical care. Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child's condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back. If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture). If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It's usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) - Lightheadedness or feeling faint - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache - Ongoing vomiting - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing - Stumbling or difficulty walking - Fainting - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate - Numbness or weakness - Shortness of breath - A high fever - A very stiff neck - A head injury - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis. - Meniere's disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear. - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension. - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance. - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much. - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia). - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety. - Overheating and dehydration. If you're active in hot weather, or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness. - A past episode of dizziness. If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you're having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina or blood vessel problems. - Balance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you're experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These may cause drowsiness. Nondrowsy antihistamines aren't as effective. - If your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration, rest in a cool place and drink water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others).\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Below is an overview of what modern medicine can (and, just as importantly, cannot yet) do for optic-nerve atrophy, together with practical next steps if you would like to be evaluated at our center.\n\n1. What optic-nerve atrophy means  \n\u2022 The optic nerve is made up of roughly 1.2 million long nerve fibers (axons) that carry visual information from the eye to the brain.  \n\u2022 \u201cAtrophy\u201d means those fibers have been permanently damaged. Typical causes include head trauma, glaucoma, lack of blood flow, inflammation, tumors pressing on the nerve, toxins, or severe nutritional deficiency.  \n\u2022 Once an axon has died, today\u2019s routine medical and surgical techniques cannot bring it back to life. Treatment therefore focuses on:  \n  \u2013 Removing or controlling the original cause (if it is still present);  \n  \u2013 Preventing additional damage; and  \n  \u2013 Helping the person use the remaining vision in the most effective way (low-vision rehabilitation).\n\n2. Evidence-based treatment options available today  \nA. Identify and treat any ongoing or preventable cause  \n   \u2022 Neuro-imaging (MRI) to be sure there is no compressive mass that could still be relieved.  \n   \u2022 Blood tests for vitamin B12, folate, copper, thyroid, and autoimmune markers; correcting any deficiency can protect remaining fibers.  \n   \u2022 Pressure-lowering therapy if glaucoma is present.  \n   \u2022 Immunosuppressive or antiviral medicines if an active inflammatory or infectious optic neuritis is discovered.  \n   \u2022 Stopping optic-nerve-toxic drugs (e.g., ethambutol, amiodarone) or environmental toxins.\n\nB. Low-vision and rehabilitation services  \n   \u2022 High-powered reading lenses, magnifiers, telescopic or electronic devices (CCTV, video magnifiers).  \n   \u2022 Orientation & mobility training, white-cane instruction, adaptive software (screen readers, voice-assistant tech).  \n   \u2022 Occupational-therapy-based daily-living skills. Studies show these steps significantly improve independence and quality of life even when visual-acuity numbers do not change.\n\nC. Experimental or research-stage approaches (not yet proven, not standard of care)  \n   \u2022 Electrical stimulation therapy (transcorneal or transorbital microcurrent): early trials show modest improvements in some patients, but results are inconsistent and long-term benefit is unproven.  \n   \u2022 Stem-cell\u2013derived retinal ganglion or optic-nerve cell implants: in animal models there is partial regeneration; human clinical trials are just beginning and are tightly regulated.  \n   \u2022 Gene-therapy approaches and neuro-protective biologics (e.g., CNTF, BDNF): still pre-clinical or phase-I.  \n   \u2022 \u201cReactive optic-nerve\u201d or \u201cneuro-reactivation\u201d procedures sometimes advertised in various countries have not been confirmed by peer-reviewed research to restore function after long-standing atrophy.\n\nBecause you have had no perception of vision for approximately 16 years, the chance of recovering sight with currently validated treatments is unfortunately extremely low. Any clinic promising a full cure should be approached with caution and a request for peer-reviewed data.\n\n3. What our hospital can offer  \n1) Comprehensive neuro-ophthalmology evaluation: review of records, detailed eye exam, visual-field testing, optical-coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve, visual-evoked potentials (VEP), and high-resolution MRI if needed.  \n2) Low-vision rehabilitation program.  \n3) Screening for eligibility in ongoing clinical trials (electrical stimulation, neuro-protective medications, or future stem-cell/gene-therapy studies once they are approved). Trial enrollment is free, but only a small proportion of patients meet the inclusion criteria.  \n4) Psychological and social-work support services.\n\n4. Estimated costs (self-pay, before any insurance or charity adjustment)  \n\u2022 Initial out-patient neuro-ophthalmology consultation: USD 250\u2013400.  \n\u2022 Diagnostic imaging/tests (OCT, visual fields, VEP, MRI if ordered): USD 600\u20131",

Below is an overview of what modern medicine can (and, just as importantly, cannot yet) do for optic-nerve atrophy, together with practical next steps if you would like to be evaluated at our center.\n\n1. What optic-nerve atrophy means  \n\u2022 The optic nerve is made up of roughly 1.2 million long nerve fibers (axons) that carry visual information from the eye to the brain.  \n\u2022 \u201cAtrophy\u201d means those fibers have been permanently damaged. Typical causes include head trauma, glaucoma, lack of blood flow, inflammation, tumors pressing on the nerve, toxins, or severe nutritional deficiency.  \n\u2022 Once an axon has died, today\u2019s routine medical and surgical techniques cannot bring it back to life. Treatment therefore focuses on:  \n  \u2013 Removing or controlling the original cause (if it is still present);  \n  \u2013 Preventing additional damage; and  \n  \u2013 Helping the person use the remaining vision in the most effective way (low-vision rehabilitation).\n\n2. Evidence-based treatment options available today  \nA. Identify and treat any ongoing or preventable cause  \n   \u2022 Neuro-imaging (MRI) to be sure there is no compressive mass that could still be relieved.  \n   \u2022 Blood tests for vitamin B12, folate, copper, thyroid, and autoimmune markers; correcting any deficiency can protect remaining fibers.  \n   \u2022 Pressure-lowering therapy if glaucoma is present.  \n   \u2022 Immunosuppressive or antiviral medicines if an active inflammatory or infectious optic neuritis is discovered.  \n   \u2022 Stopping optic-nerve-toxic drugs (e.g., ethambutol, amiodarone) or environmental toxins.\n\nB. Low-vision and rehabilitation services  \n   \u2022 High-powered reading lenses, magnifiers, telescopic or electronic devices (CCTV, video magnifiers).  \n   \u2022 Orientation & mobility training, white-cane instruction, adaptive software (screen readers, voice-assistant tech).  \n   \u2022 Occupational-therapy-based daily-living skills. Studies show these steps significantly improve independence and quality of life even when visual-acuity numbers do not change.\n\nC. Experimental or research-stage approaches (not yet proven, not standard of care)  \n   \u2022 Electrical stimulation therapy (transcorneal or transorbital microcurrent): early trials show modest improvements in some patients, but results are inconsistent and long-term benefit is unproven.  \n   \u2022 Stem-cell\u2013derived retinal ganglion or optic-nerve cell implants: in animal models there is partial regeneration; human clinical trials are just beginning and are tightly regulated.  \n   \u2022 Gene-therapy approaches and neuro-protective biologics (e.g., CNTF, BDNF): still pre-clinical or phase-I.  \n   \u2022 \u201cReactive optic-nerve\u201d or \u201cneuro-reactivation\u201d procedures sometimes advertised in various countries have not been confirmed by peer-reviewed research to restore function after long-standing atrophy.\n\nBecause you have had no perception of vision for approximately 16 years, the chance of recovering sight with currently validated treatments is unfortunately extremely low. Any clinic promising a full cure should be approached with caution and a request for peer-reviewed data.\n\n3. What our hospital can offer  \n1) Comprehensive neuro-ophthalmology evaluation: review of records, detailed eye exam, visual-field testing, optical-coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve, visual-evoked potentials (VEP), and high-resolution MRI if needed.  \n2) Low-vision rehabilitation program.  \n3) Screening for eligibility in ongoing clinical trials (electrical stimulation, neuro-protective medications, or future stem-cell/gene-therapy studies once they are approved). Trial enrollment is free, but only a small proportion of patients meet the inclusion criteria.  \n4) Psychological and social-work support services.\n\n4. Estimated costs (self-pay, before any insurance or charity adjustment)  \n\u2022 Initial out-patient neuro-ophthalmology consultation: USD 250\u2013400.  \n\u2022 Diagnostic imaging/tests (OCT, visual fields, VEP, MRI if ordered): USD 600\u20131\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nOptic nerve atrophy (Treatment): Damage from optic nerve atrophy cannot be reversed.

The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers. A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers. If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include: - Antidepressants - Blood pressure medicines - Seizure medicines Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month. Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you. TREATING AN ATTACK Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that: - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine. - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys. If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.\u00a0The group of medicines most often used is called triptans. Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself. Feverfew is an herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated.

The blood test  \n   \u2022 Name: Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) IgG antibody titer (usually an ELISA test).  \n   \u2022 What it looks for: IgG antibodies that remain in your blood for life after natural chickenpox or after varicella vaccine.  \n   \u2022 How it is done: A routine blood draw sent to any standard laboratory.\n\n2. Interpreting the result  \n   \u2022 \u201cPositive,\u201d \u201creactive,\u201d or a numerical value above the laboratory\u2019s cut-off \u2192 You are immune; that virtually always means you have had chickenpox (or were vaccinated).  \n   \u2022 \u201cNegative,\u201d \u201cnon-reactive,\u201d or below the cut-off \u2192 No evidence of immunity; you are assumed never to have had chickenpox (and you are at risk if exposed).  \n   \u2022 \u201cEquivocal\u201d \u2192 Borderline; the test is repeated or you are treated as non-immune.\n\n3. What the test does NOT tell you  \n   \u2022 It cannot distinguish whether the antibodies came from natural disease or from the 2-dose varicella vaccine you might have received in childhood.  \n   \u2022 An IgM test would look for a very recent or current infection; it is not useful for the question you are asking.\n\nWHY THE TEST MATTERS\n\nIf you truly never had chickenpox (and have not been vaccinated), you are susceptible to the primary infection and need the varicella vaccine series (two doses 4\u20138 weeks apart) before you ever worry about shingles vaccine.\n\nIF THE TEST IS POSITIVE (IMMUNE)\n\n\u2022 You do not need the varicella vaccine.  \n\u2022 You are eligible for shingles (zoster) vaccination when you reach the recommended age (see below).\n\nIF THE TEST IS NEGATIVE (NOT IMMUNE)\n\n\u2022 First get immunized with the two-dose varicella vaccine.  \n\u2022 After you are protected against chickenpox, you would still be a candidate for shingles vaccine when you are older, because shingles results from reactivation of the virus that will then be latent in your nerves.\n\nDO YOU EVEN NEED THE TEST?\n\n\u2022 Public-health guidelines consider almost every adult born in the United States before 1980 to be immune to chickenpox, because >90\u2009% of them had the disease as children (even if they do not remember it).  \n\u2022 For that reason, the CDC does NOT recommend routine serologic testing before giving shingles vaccine, unless you have a specific reason to doubt past infection (e.g., born and raised in a tropical country where adult susceptibility is higher, never vaccinated, or certain you never had the illness).\n\nWHICH SHINGLES VACCINE?\n\n\u2022 Zostavax (live, single dose) was licensed for adults \u226560 y but is no longer sold in the U.S. as of 2020.  \n\u2022 Shingrix (recombinant, non-live, two doses 2\u20136 months apart) is now the preferred vaccine for adults 50 y and older, regardless of whether they recall chickenpox or have had a prior zoster episode.  \n\u2022 You cannot receive Shingrix until age 50; if you are younger your immediate concern would be varicella vaccination if you are not immune.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAsk your clinician for a VZV IgG antibody test if you truly are unsure of past chickenpox and need documented proof.  \n\u2022 Positive IgG \u2192 you\u2019ve had it (or were vaccinated) \u2192 no need for varicella vaccine; plan on Shingrix at 50+.  \n\u2022 Negative IgG \u2192 you\u2019ve never had it \u2192 get the 2-dose varicella vaccine now; plan on Shingrix at 50+.  \n\nDiscuss the timing and vaccine choice with your healthcare provider, especially if you have immune-compromising conditions, allergies, or are pregnant.",

What the test does NOT tell you  \n   \u2022 It cannot distinguish whether the antibodies came from natural disease or from the 2-dose varicella vaccine you might have received in childhood.  \n   \u2022 An IgM test would look for a very recent or current infection; it is not useful for the question you are asking.\n\nWHY THE TEST MATTERS\n\nIf you truly never had chickenpox (and have not been vaccinated), you are susceptible to the primary infection and need the varicella vaccine series (two doses 4\u20138 weeks apart) before you ever worry about shingles vaccine.\n\nIF THE TEST IS POSITIVE (IMMUNE)\n\n\u2022 You do not need the varicella vaccine.  \n\u2022 You are eligible for shingles (zoster) vaccination when you reach the recommended age (see below).\n\nIF THE TEST IS NEGATIVE (NOT IMMUNE)\n\n\u2022 First get immunized with the two-dose varicella vaccine.  \n\u2022 After you are protected against chickenpox, you would still be a candidate for shingles vaccine when you are older, because shingles results from reactivation of the virus that will then be latent in your nerves.\n\nDO YOU EVEN NEED THE TEST?\n\n\u2022 Public-health guidelines consider almost every adult born in the United States before 1980 to be immune to chickenpox, because >90\u2009% of them had the disease as children (even if they do not remember it).  \n\u2022 For that reason, the CDC does NOT recommend routine serologic testing before giving shingles vaccine, unless you have a specific reason to doubt past infection (e.g., born and raised in a tropical country where adult susceptibility is higher, never vaccinated, or certain you never had the illness).\n\nWHICH SHINGLES VACCINE?\n\n\u2022 Zostavax (live, single dose) was licensed for adults \u226560 y but is no longer sold in the U.S. as of 2020.  \n\u2022 Shingrix (recombinant, non-live, two doses 2\u20136 months apart) is now the preferred vaccine for adults 50 y and older, regardless of whether they recall chickenpox or have had a prior zoster episode.  \n\u2022 You cannot receive Shingrix until age 50; if you are younger your immediate concern would be varicella vaccination if you are not immune.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAsk your clinician for a VZV IgG antibody test if you truly are unsure of past chickenpox and need documented proof.  \n\u2022 Positive IgG \u2192 you\u2019ve had it (or were vaccinated) \u2192 no need for varicella vaccine; plan on Shingrix at 50+.  \n\u2022 Negative IgG \u2192 you\u2019ve never had it \u2192 get the 2-dose varicella vaccine now; plan on Shingrix at 50+.  \n\nDiscuss the timing and vaccine choice with your healthcare provider, especially if you have immune-compromising conditions, allergies, or are pregnant.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nChickenpox (Exams and Tests): Your health care provider can most often diagnose chickenpox by looking at the rash and asking questions about the person's medical history.

Have we confirmed the diagnosis genetically\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nAdult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (Treatment): There is no cure or known treatment to stop the progression of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy. [2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4]\u00a0 CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina. This can cause vision loss on its own. If CNV does develop, anti-VEGF therapy such as Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab can control and even reverse the CNV. However anti-VEGF therapy does not stop or reverse the vision loss caused by adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, only the extra vision loss that is due to also developing CNV. [2]\u00a0 Although vision loss is usually slow, when vision is impaired significantly, people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy may be referred for low vision testing and rehabilitation. Low vision rehabilitation can help maintain and optimize reading ability and improve overall quality of life.

It is passed down in families (inherited). Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births. One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing - Developmental delay - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD) - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting - Inward bend of the small finger - Learning disorders - Mild to moderate intellectual disability - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music - Short, compared to the rest of the person's family - Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip - Prominent lips with an open mouth - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include: - Narrowing of some blood vessels - Farsightedness - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles - High blood pressure - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye Tests for Williams syndrome include: - Blood pressure check - Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test) - Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound - Kidney ultrasound There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms. It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice. The following organization provides additional information about Williams Syndrome: Williams Syndrome Association -- www.williams-syndrome.org About 75% of people with Williams syndrome have some intellectual disability. Most people will not live as long as normal due to the various medical issues and other possible complications. Most people require full-time caregivers and often live in supervised group homes. Complications may include: - Calcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problems - Death (in rare cases from anesthesia) - Heart failure due to narrowed blood vessels - Pain in the abdomen Many of the symptoms and signs of Williams syndrome may not be obvious at birth. Call your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome. There is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome. Prenatal testing is available for couples with a family history of Williams syndrome who wish to conceive.

Below is a plain-language overview, followed by reliable sources for deeper reading and support.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. What is Lewy Body Dementia?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Definition  \n  LBD is a progressive brain disease caused by the build-up of abnormal protein clumps called Lewy bodies (made of \u03b1-synuclein) in brain cells. These same proteins are involved in Parkinson\u2019s disease; that is why LBD shows a mix of Alzheimer-like memory problems and Parkinson-like motor symptoms.\n\n\u2022 Who gets it?  \n  \u2013 About 1.4 million Americans (worldwide estimates 3\u20134 million).  \n  \u2013 Usually appears after age 50\u201355 (average onset ~70), but can occur earlier.  \n  \u2013 Slight male predominance.  \n  \u2013 Most cases are sporadic; rare families carry gene mutations (e.g., SNCA, GBA).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Key Symptoms (often appear together but fluctuate day to day)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Cognitive decline  \n   \u2013 Problems with attention, planning, multitasking; memory may be less impaired early on than in Alzheimer\u2019s.  \n   \u2013 Marked fluctuations (\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d days or hours).\n\n2. Visual hallucinations (up to 80 %)  \n   \u2013 Vivid, well-formed images of people or animals; often early in the disease.\n\n3. Parkinson-like motor features  \n   \u2013 Slowness (bradykinesia), stiffness, shuffling gait, stooped posture, loss of facial expression, tremor (less prominent than in Parkinson\u2019s disease).\n\n4. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)  \n   \u2013 Acting out dreams (talking, punching, falling out of bed) years before other symptoms.\n\n5.

Thank you\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nLewy Body Dementia (LBD)  \u2013 sometimes called Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) \u2013 is the second-most common degenerative dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), yet it is still under-recognized. Below is a plain-language overview, followed by reliable sources for deeper reading and support.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. What is Lewy Body Dementia?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Definition  \n  LBD is a progressive brain disease caused by the build-up of abnormal protein clumps called Lewy bodies (made of \u03b1-synuclein) in brain cells. These same proteins are involved in Parkinson\u2019s disease; that is why LBD shows a mix of Alzheimer-like memory problems and Parkinson-like motor symptoms.\n\n\u2022 Who gets it?  \n  \u2013 About 1.4 million Americans (worldwide estimates 3\u20134 million).  \n  \u2013 Usually appears after age 50\u201355 (average onset ~70), but can occur earlier.  \n  \u2013 Slight male predominance.  \n  \u2013 Most cases are sporadic; rare families carry gene mutations (e.g., SNCA, GBA).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Key Symptoms (often appear together but fluctuate day to day)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Cognitive decline  \n   \u2013 Problems with attention, planning, multitasking; memory may be less impaired early on than in Alzheimer\u2019s.  \n   \u2013 Marked fluctuations (\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d days or hours).\n\n2. Visual hallucinations (up to 80 %)  \n   \u2013 Vivid, well-formed images of people or animals; often early in the disease.\n\n3. Parkinson-like motor features  \n   \u2013 Slowness (bradykinesia), stiffness, shuffling gait, stooped posture, loss of facial expression, tremor (less prominent than in Parkinson\u2019s disease).\n\n4. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)  \n   \u2013 Acting out dreams (talking, punching, falling out of bed) years before other symptoms.\n\n5. Autonomic dysfunction  \n   \u2013 Dizziness or fainting (low blood pressure), constipation, urinary urgency, erectile dysfunction, temperature or sweating abnormalities.\n\n6. Mood / behavioral changes  \n   \u2013 Depression, apathy, anxiety, delusions, sensitivity to certain drugs (see section 4).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.

Protein deposits, called Lewy bodies, develop in nerve cells in the brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement (motor control). Lewy body dementia causes a progressive decline in mental abilities. People with Lewy body dementia may experience visual hallucinations, and changes in alertness and attention. Other effects include Parkinson's disease-like symptoms such as rigid muscles, slow movement and tremors.

Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the disease\u2014one from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves. CF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Overview Mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. If you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. These enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. If you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh). CF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.) Outlook The symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often. Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF. As treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. Early treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. Your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas Mucoviscidosis (MU-ko-vis-ih-DO-sis) Mucoviscidosis of the pancreas Pancreas fibrocystic disease Pancreatic cystic fibrosis A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. Research suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF. More than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. How Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited? Every person inherits two CFTR genes\u2014one from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF. Children who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. The image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. Example of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects both males and females and people from all racial and ethnic groups. However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent. CF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans. More than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers. The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body. Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF. People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage. As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis). Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. Digestive System Signs and Symptoms In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines. As a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as: Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain. Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. Diabetes. Gallstones. Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms Men who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis. Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications. Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia. Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests. Newborn Screening All States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly. Sweat Test If a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat. For this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling. Sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF. Other Tests If you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Genetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF. A chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air. A sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. A sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment. Prenatal Screening If you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). In amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal. In CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing People who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children. If you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier. A genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include: Preventing and controlling lung infections Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines Providing enough nutrition Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body) Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital. Specialists Involved If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF. Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers. The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. Treatment for Lung Problems The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Chest Physical Therapy CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up. You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs. Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as: An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor. An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up. A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus. A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls. Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways. Exercise Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition. However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood. If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first. Medicines If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older). Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital. Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral. Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms. Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. If other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include: Exercise training Nutritional counseling Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it Energy-conserving techniques Breathing strategies Psychological counseling and/or group support PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR. For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article. Treatment for Digestive Problems CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs. In addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include: Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins. Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb. High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients. A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising. A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep. Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes. Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density. If you or your child has cystic fibrosis (CF), you should learn as much as you can about the disease. Work closely with your doctors to learn how to manage CF. Ongoing Care Having ongoing medical care by a team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists who specialize in CF is important. These specialists often are located at major medical centers or CF Care Centers. The United States has more than 100 CF Care Centers. Most of these centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. It's standard to have CF checkups every 3 months. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get an annual flu shot and other vaccines. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. In between checkups, be sure to contact your doctor if you have: Blood in your mucus, increased amounts of mucus, or a change in the color or consistency of your mucus. Decreased energy or appetite. Severe constipation or diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or vomit that's dark green. A fever, which is a sign of infection. (However, you may still have a serious infection that needs treatment even if you don't have a fever.) Transition of Care Better treatments for CF allow people who have the disease to live longer now than in the past. Thus, the move from pediatric care to adult care is an important step in treatment. If your child has CF, encourage him or her to learn about the disease and take an active role in treatment. This will help prepare your child for the transition to adult care. CF Care Centers can help provide age-appropriate treatment throughout the transition period and into adulthood. They also will support the transition to adult care by balancing medical needs with other developmental factors, such as increased independence, relationships, and employment. Talk with your child's health care team for more information about how to help your child move from pediatric care to adult care. Lifestyle Changes In between medical checkups, you can practice good self-care and follow a healthy lifestyle. For example, follow a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of foods you should include in your diet. Other lifestyle changes include: Not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke Washing your hands often to lower your risk of infection Exercising regularly and drinking lots of fluids Doing chest physical therapy (as your doctor recommends) Other Concerns Although CF requires daily care, most people who have the disease are able to attend school and work. Adults who have CF can expect to have normal sex lives. Most men who have the disease are infertile (unable to have children). However, modern fertility treatments may help them. Women who have CF may find it hard to get pregnant, but they usually can have children. If you have CF, you should talk with your doctor if you're planning a pregnancy. Although CF can cause fertility problems, men and women who have the disease should still have protected sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Emotional Issues Living with CF may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with CF. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety.

The NICHD supports and conducts research on the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and inheritance of Fragile X and its associated conditions, Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). All three conditions result from changes in the same gene on the X chromosome.\u00a0 What is Fragile X syndrome? Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a person\u2019s development, especially that person\u2019s behavior and ability to learn. In addition, Fragile X can affect: - Communication skills - Physical appearance - Sensitivity to noise, light, or other sensory information Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) People with Fragile X syndrome may not have noticeable symptoms, or they can have more serious symptoms that range from learning disabilities to cognitive and behavior problems. How is FMR1 mutation related? \u00bb Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by changes (mutations) in the FMR1 gene found on the X chromosome. This mutation affects how the body makes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which can cause the symptoms of Fragile X. In a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps to start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene includes many repeats\u2014repeated instances of a specific DNA sequence called the CGG sequence. A normal FMR1 gene has between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. People with between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation of the gene. The premutation may cause the gene to not work properly, but it does not cause intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The premutation is linked to the disorders FXPOI and FXTAS. However, not all people with the premutation show symptoms of FXPOI or FXTAS. People with 200 or more repeats in the promoter part of the gene have a full mutation, meaning the gene might not work at all. People with a full mutation often have Fragile X syndrome. The number of repeats, also called the \u201csize of the mutation,\u201d affects the type of symptoms and how serious the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome will be. Inheriting Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to children. Anyone with the FMR1 gene mutation can pass it to their children. However, a person who inherits the gene mutation may not develop Fragile X syndrome. Males will pass it down to all of their daughters and not their sons. Females have a 50/50 chance to pass it along to both their sons and daughters. In some cases, an FMR1 premutation can change to a full mutation when it is passed from parent to child. Read more about how FMR1 changes as it is passed from parent to child. \u00ab\u00a0 Condition Information What causes it?\u00a0\u00bb Fragile X results from a change or mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which is found on the X chromosome. The gene normally makes a protein called Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. This protein is important for creating and maintaining connections between cells in the brain and nervous system. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which often causes the symptoms of Fragile X. Not everyone with the mutated FMR1 gene has symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, because the body may still be able to make FMRP. A few things affect how much FMRP the body can make: - The size of the mutation. Some people have a smaller mutation (a lower number of repeats) in their FMR1 gene, while others have big mutations (a large number of repeats) in the gene. If the mutation is small, the body may be able to make some of the protein. Having the protein available makes the symptoms milder. - The number of cells that have the mutation. Because not every cell in the body is exactly the same, some cells might have the FMR1 mutation while others do not. This situation is called mosaicism (pronounced moh-ZAY-uh-siz-uhm). If the mutation is in most of the body\u2019s cells, the person will probably have symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. If the mutation is in only some of the cells, the person might not have any symptoms at all or only mild symptoms. - Being female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have only one. In females, if the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome has the mutation, the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome might not have the mutation. Even if one of the female\u2019s genes has a very large mutation, the body can usually make at least some FMRP, leading to milder symptoms. \u00ab\u00a0 How is FMR1 mutation related? How many people are affected?\u00a0\u00bb About 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females have Fragile X syndrome. How many people have the Fragile X premutation? Although Fragile X syndrome is relatively rare, premutations in the FMR1 gene are relatively common: A recent study of 6,747 people found that 1 in 151 women and 1 in 468 men had the premutation. People with the premutation might not have any symptoms of Fragile X. However, the premutation can sometimes expand in the next generation, which can cause Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What causes it? What are common symptoms\u00a0\u00bb People with Fragile X do not all have the same signs and symptoms, but they do have some things in common. Symptoms are often milder in females than in males. - Intelligence and learning. Many people with Fragile X have problems with intellectual functioning. - These problems can range from the mild, such as learning disorders or problems with mathematics, to the severe, such as an intellectual or developmental disability. - The syndrome may affect the ability to think, reason, and learn. - Because many people with Fragile X also have attention disorders, hyperactivity, anxiety, and language-processing problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score suggests. - Physical. Most infants and younger children with Fragile X don\u2019t have any specific physical features of this syndrome. When these children start to go through puberty, however, many will begin to develop certain features that are typical of those with Fragile X. - These features include a narrow face, large head, large ears, flexible joints, flat feet, and a prominent forehead. - These physical signs become more obvious with age. - Behavioral, social, and emotional. Most children with Fragile X have some behavioral challenges. - They may be afraid or anxious in new situations. - They may have trouble making eye contact with other people. - Boys, especially, may have trouble paying attention or be aggressive. - Girls may be shy around new people. They may also have attention disorders and problems with hyperactivity. - Speech and language. Most boys with Fragile X have some problems with speech and language. - They may have trouble speaking clearly, may stutter, or may leave out parts of words. They may also have problems understanding other people\u2019s social cues, such as tone of voice or specific types of body language. - Girls usually do not have severe problems with speech or language. - Some children with Fragile X begin talking later than typically developing children. Most will talk eventually, but a few might stay nonverbal throughout their lives. - Sensory. Many children with Fragile X are bothered by certain sensations, such as bright light, loud noises, or the way certain clothing feels on their bodies. - These sensory issues might cause them to act out or display behavior problems. \u00ab\u00a0 How many people are affected? How is it diagnosed?\u00a0\u00bb Health care providers often use a blood sample to diagnose Fragile X. The health care provider will take a sample of blood and will send it to a laboratory, which will determine what form of the FMR1 gene is present. Prenatal Testing (During Pregnancy) Pregnant women who have an FMR1 premutation or full mutation may pass that mutated gene on to their children. A prenatal test allows health care providers to detect the mutated gene in the developing fetus. This important information helps families and providers to prepare for Fragile X syndrome and to intervene as early as possible. Possible types of prenatal tests include: - Amniocentesis (pronounced am-nee-oh-sen-TEE-sis). A health care provider takes a sample of amniotic (pronounced am-nee-OT-ik) fluid, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. - Chorionic villus (pronounced KOHR-ee-on-ik VILL-uhs) sampling. A health care provider takes a sample of cells from the placenta, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. Because prenatal testing involves some risk to the mother and fetus, if you or a family member is considering prenatal testing for Fragile X, discuss all the risks and benefits with your health care provider. Prenatal testing is not very common, and many parents do not know they carry the mutation. Therefore, parents usually start to notice symptoms in their children when they are infants or toddlers. The average age at diagnosis is 36 months for boys and 42 months for girls. Diagnosis of Children Many parents first notice symptoms of delayed development in their infants or toddlers. These symptoms may include delays in speech and language skills, social and emotional difficulties, and being sensitive to certain sensations. Children may also be delayed in or have problems with motor skills such as learning to walk. A health care provider can perform developmental screening to determine the nature of delays in a child. If a health care provider suspects the child has Fragile X syndrome, he/she can refer parents to a clinical geneticist, who can perform a genetic test for Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What are common symptoms? What are the treatments?\u00a0\u00bb \u200b\u200b There is no single treatment for Fragile X syndrome, but there are treatments that help minimize the symptoms of the condition. Individuals with Fragile X who receive appropriate education, therapy services, and medications have the best chance of using all of their individual capabilities and skills. Even those with an intellectual or developmental disability can learn to master many self-help skills. Early intervention is important. Because a young child\u2019s brain is still forming, early intervention gives children the best start possible and the greatest chance of developing a full range of skills. The sooner a child with Fragile X syndrome gets treatment, the more opportunity there is for learning. \u00ab How is it diagnosed? Educational treatments \u00bb Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? Among the other conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome are the following: - Autism spectrum disorder. From 30% to 50% of people with Fragile X also meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. - Mitral valve prolapse. In mitral valve prolapse (pronounced MY-truhl valv PROH-laps), a heart condition, the valve that separates the upper and lower left chambers of the heart does not work properly. This condition is usually not life-threatening, but in severe cases, surgery might be required to correct the problem. - Seizures. Between 6% and 20% of children with Fragile X syndrome have seizures. Seizures associated with the syndrome are more common in boys than in girls. [top] How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? The gene for Fragile X is carried on the X chromosome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children. - A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will pass that gene on only to his daughters. To his sons he will pass on a Y chromosome, which doesn\u2019t transmit Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, a father with the altered gene on his X chromosome and a mother with normal X chromosomes would have daughters with the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene. - A father can pass on the premutation form of the FMR1 gene to his daughters but not the full mutation. Even if the father himself has a full mutation of this gene, it appears that sperm can carry only the premutation. Scientists don\u2019t understand how or why fathers can pass on only the milder form of Fragile X to their daughters. This remains an area of focused research. - Mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, so if a mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If a mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene. - These 50-50 odds apply for each child the parents have. Having one child with the FMR1 mutation does not increase or decrease the chances of having another child with the mutated FMR1 gene. This is also true for the severity of the symptoms. Having one child with mild symptoms does not mean that the other children will have severe symptoms, and having a child with severe symptoms does not mean that the other children will have mild symptoms. [top] How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? The repeats in the promoter part of the FMR1 gene are unstable, and sometimes the number of repeats increases from one generation to the next. A premutation gene is less stable than a full mutation gene. So as it passes from parent to child, a premutation gene might expand to become a full mutation gene. The chances of expansion depend on the number of repeats in the promoter of the premutation gene: Normal FMR1 genes that have 5 to 44 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered normal. When these genes are passed from parent to child, the number of repeats does not increase or decrease. Intermediate FMR1 genes with 45 to 54 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered intermediate, or borderline. An intermediate gene may expand from one generation to the next, depending on which parent has the gene. Mother to Child About 14% of the time, when a mother passes an intermediate gene to her child, the CGG repeats increase to a number seen with premutations. Research shows that an intermediate gene will not become a full mutation gene in one generation, and so a mother with an intermediate gene will not have a child with a full mutation. Father to Child When intermediate genes are transmitted from father to child, they are generally stable and do not increase to premutations. Premutations Premutation (55 to 199 CGG repeats) FMR1 genes can expand to a full mutation from one generation to the next. The risk of expansion depends on which parent has the gene and the number of repeats in that gene. Mother to Child An FMR1 gene from the mother with 100 CGG repeats is very likely to expand to a full mutation when passed to the child. An FMR1 gene from the mother with 70 to 79 CGG repeats has about a 30% chance of expanding to a full mutation in one generation. Father to Child Premutations passed from father to child have almost no chance of expanding to full mutations.

It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take rasagiline at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rasagiline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of rasagiline and may increase your dose based upon your body's response to this medication. Do not stop taking rasagiline without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking rasagiline, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as a fever; muscle stiffness; unsteadiness, wobbliness, or lack of coordination; or changes in consciousness. Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms when your dose of rasagiline is decreased.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both. To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Most reactions fall into one of three stages:\n\n\u2022 Mild redness and dryness (erythema / dry desquamation)  \n\u2022 Blistering or weeping skin (moist desquamation)  \n\u2022 Ulceration or an open wound (late\u2010stage/chronic injury)  \n\nGeneral first-aid steps\n1.  Stop or limit the exposure and gently wash the skin with lukewarm running water and mild soap to remove any residual contaminants or creams.  \n2.  Cool the area with plain, cool (not ice-cold) water for 10\u201320 minutes to soothe pain and limit tissue damage.  \n3.  Pat dry with a soft, clean towel\u2014don\u2019t rub.  \n4.  Leave intact blisters alone; if they break, treat as an open wound (see below).  \n5.  Cover with a non-stick, low-adherent sterile dressing or clean, loose cotton clothing.  \n6.  Take an over-the-counter pain reliever (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) if needed and if not contraindicated.  \n\nDaily home care for mild to moderate reactions\n\u2022 Clean once or twice a day with tepid water or saline; avoid harsh soaps, alcohol, perfumes, or deodorants on the area.  \n\u2022 Moisturise frequently (2-4\u00d7/day) with a bland, fragrance-free, water-based cream or aloe vera gel; apply very gently.  \n\u2022 Protect from friction, heat, sunlight, and tight clothing; wear soft cotton fabrics.  \n\u2022 Avoid adhesive tape on the skin in the treatment field\u2014use a net bandage or wrap if you must secure a dressing.  \n\u2022 If the skin itches, a 1 % hydrocortisone cream or an oral antihistamine can help, but use steroid creams only with your clinician\u2019s approval while radiotherapy is ongoing.  \n\nWhen the skin is wet or blistered (\u201cmoist desquamation\u201d)\n\u2022 Continue gentle cleansing with saline or diluted (\u00bc-strength) vinegar soaks.  \n\u2022 Apply a hydrogel, hydrocolloid, silicone, or silver-impregnated non-stick dressing (e.g., Mepilex\u00ae Lite, Aquacel\u00ae Ag) and secure loosely.

Below is an outline of the usual steps and key points.  Always follow the exact instructions you were given by your prescriber, pharmacist, or nurse\u2014those instructions take priority over this general guide.\n\n1. Storage and preparation  \n\u2022 Keep the syringe in its original sealed tray in a refrigerator (36-46 \u00b0F / 2-8 \u00b0C).  \n\u2022 On the day of the injection, remove it from the fridge 30\u201360 minutes beforehand so it can warm to room temperature.  Do not heat it in any other way and do not leave it out for more than 24 hours.  \n\u2022 Inspect the solution through the viewing window; it should be clear to pale yellow with no particles.\n\n2. Who may give the injection  \n\u2022 Many people receive lanreotide at a clinic every 4 weeks.  After proper training, most adults or caregivers can give it at home.  The first injection(s) should be supervised by a health-care professional.\n\n3. Choosing an injection site  \n\u2022 Preferred site: upper outer quadrant of the buttock (alternate right/left each time).  \n\u2022 If you are self-injecting and cannot reach the buttock safely, the upper outer thigh is allowed in some countries\u2014confirm with your provider.  \n\u2022 Do not inject into areas that are scarred, bruised, reddened, or hard, and stay at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from the belly button.\n\n4. Step-by-step injection  \na. Wash your hands and clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab; let it dry.  \nb. Open the blister pack, remove the syringe, and pull off the protective needle cap without touching the needle.  The plunger is already set and will lock automatically when the dose is finished.  \nc. Hold the syringe like a dart with the needle pointing straight down.  \nd. Pinch a fold of skin (about 1 inch / 2\u20133 cm).  \ne. Insert the needle swiftly at a 90-degree angle until the hub touches the skin.  \nf. Release the pinched skin and push the plunger slowly and steadily all the way in.  Keep pressing until you hear the audible \u201cclick.\u201d  This click means the full dose has been delivered and the safety shield has begun to cover the needle.  \ng. Wait about 10 seconds, then withdraw the needle straight out.  \nh. Apply gentle pressure with gauze; do not rub.  \ni. Drop the entire syringe (needle first) into a puncture-proof sharps container.\n\n5. Dosing schedule  \nTypical maintenance doses are 60 mg, 90 mg, or 120 mg every 28 days (sometimes every 6\u20138 weeks once you are stable).  Never change the dose or timing without medical advice.\n\n6. If you miss a dose  \nContact your health-care provider.  In many cases the dose can be given within 14 days of the scheduled date; otherwise you may be told to skip it and restart your normal calendar.\n\n7. When to seek help  \nCall your provider for severe injection-site pain, signs of infection, gallbladder pain, unexpected changes in blood sugar, slow heartbeat, or any reaction you are unsure about.\n\nRemember: these are general instructions.  Your physician, nurse, or pharmacist may adapt them to suit your individual situation.",

Who may give the injection  \n\u2022 Many people receive lanreotide at a clinic every 4 weeks.  After proper training, most adults or caregivers can give it at home.  The first injection(s) should be supervised by a health-care professional.\n\n3. Choosing an injection site  \n\u2022 Preferred site: upper outer quadrant of the buttock (alternate right/left each time).  \n\u2022 If you are self-injecting and cannot reach the buttock safely, the upper outer thigh is allowed in some countries\u2014confirm with your provider.  \n\u2022 Do not inject into areas that are scarred, bruised, reddened, or hard, and stay at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from the belly button.\n\n4. Step-by-step injection  \na. Wash your hands and clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab; let it dry.  \nb. Open the blister pack, remove the syringe, and pull off the protective needle cap without touching the needle.  The plunger is already set and will lock automatically when the dose is finished.  \nc. Hold the syringe like a dart with the needle pointing straight down.  \nd. Pinch a fold of skin (about 1 inch / 2\u20133 cm).  \ne. Insert the needle swiftly at a 90-degree angle until the hub touches the skin.  \nf. Release the pinched skin and push the plunger slowly and steadily all the way in.  Keep pressing until you hear the audible \u201cclick.\u201d  This click means the full dose has been delivered and the safety shield has begun to cover the needle.  \ng. Wait about 10 seconds, then withdraw the needle straight out.  \nh. Apply gentle pressure with gauze; do not rub.  \ni. Drop the entire syringe (needle first) into a puncture-proof sharps container.\n\n5. Dosing schedule  \nTypical maintenance doses are 60 mg, 90 mg, or 120 mg every 28 days (sometimes every 6\u20138 weeks once you are stable).  Never change the dose or timing without medical advice.\n\n6. If you miss a dose  \nContact your health-care provider.  In many cases the dose can be given within 14 days of the scheduled date; otherwise you may be told to skip it and restart your normal calendar.\n\n7. When to seek help  \nCall your provider for severe injection-site pain, signs of infection, gallbladder pain, unexpected changes in blood sugar, slow heartbeat, or any reaction you are unsure about.\n\nRemember: these are general instructions.  Your physician, nurse, or pharmacist may adapt them to suit your individual situation.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHow should Lanreotide Injection be used and what is the dosage?: Lanreotide comes as a long-acting solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the upper outer area of your buttock by a doctor or nurse. Lanreotide long-acting injection is usually injected once every 4 weeks. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.

Viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis, but the condition can also be caused by other infections, heavy alcohol use, toxins, certain medications, and autoimmune disease. There are five main virus types that cause hepatitis---type A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingesting contaminated food or water. Type B commonly occurs through contact with infected blood, semen or other bodily fluid through sex, sharing needles or other drug-injection equipment or from mother to baby at birth. Hepatitis type C is a blood-borne virus that is largely spread by sharing needles or other drug injection equipment. Hepatitis D, which is transmitted through contact with infectious blood, occurs only among people with hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B, C, and D afflict more than half a billion people worldwide and are responsible for more than a million deaths a year. Chronic infection with these viruses can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. The NIAID Hepatitis Research Program supports research on all hepatitis viruses. However, commensurate with the magnitude of the medical burdens imposed by these viruses, the greatest emphasis is placed on the study of hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses, which focuses on the understanding the pathogenesis and immunology of hepatitis viruses and developing novel therapeutics and vaccines against diseases caused by hepatitis viruses. Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver. Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements Stomach pain Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer. Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent some viral forms.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Know the warning signs that should prompt a medical evaluation  \n   \u2022 Unusual, persistent fatigue  \n   \u2022 Joint pain, swelling, or morning stiffness lasting >30 minutes  \n   \u2022 Skin changes \u2013 especially a \u201cbutterfly\u201d (malar) rash across the cheeks and nose, or rashes that worsen in the sun  \n   \u2022 Fingers/toes that turn white or blue in the cold (Raynaud\u2019s)  \n   \u2022 Unexplained low-grade fevers, mouth or nose ulcers, hair loss, chest pain with deep breathing, shortness of breath, headaches, or brain-fog type symptoms  \n   \u2022 Swelling of the legs or around the eyes, dark or foamy urine (possible kidney involvement)\n\n   None of these is specific for lupus, but having several together\u2014especially in a woman of child-bearing age\u2014warrants evaluation.\n\n2. See a health-care professional (ideally a rheumatologist)  \n   There is no single \u201clupus test.\u201d Diagnosis is made by putting together:  \n   \u2022 Your history of symptoms and their pattern  \n   \u2022 A complete physical examination (skin, joints, heart, lungs, neurologic, etc.)  \n   \u2022 Laboratory and imaging studies  \n\n3. Tests commonly ordered  \n   Screening blood tests  \n   \u2022 Antinuclear antibody (ANA): positive in \u224895 % of people with lupus, but it can be positive in other conditions or even in healthy people. A negative ANA makes lupus unlikely, but not impossible.  \n   More specific antibody tests (done when ANA is positive or suspicion is high)  \n   \u2022 Anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA)  \n   \u2022 Anti-Smith (Sm)  \n   \u2022 Anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, antiphospholipid antibodies  \n   Other blood work  \n   \u2022 Complete blood count (looking for anemia, low white cells or platelets)  \n   \u2022 Comprehensive metabolic panel, creatinine, and complement levels (C3, C4)  \n   \u2022 Inflammation markers (ESR, CRP)  \n   Urine studies  \n   \u2022 Urinalysis and urine protein/creatinine ratio to detect kidney involvement  \n   Imaging or special tests (as needed)  \n   \u2022 Chest X-ray, echocardiogram, or CT if heart or lung involvement is suspected  \n   \u2022 Kidney biopsy, skin biopsy, or nerve/muscle studies if organ involvement needs confirmation\n\n4. Classification criteria your doctor may use  \n   The 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria require:  \n   \u2022 A positive ANA at least once, AND  \n   \u2022 Accumulation of \u226510 points from weighted clinical and immunologic features (joints, skin, kidney, blood counts, antibodies, etc.).  \n   These criteria are meant for research, but they help doctors organize the evidence.\n\n5. Why self-testing at home does not work  \n   \u2022 Symptoms overlap with many other disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, infections).  \n   \u2022 Lab tests must be interpreted in context; a positive ANA alone does not mean you have lupus, and a negative test does not rule it out if clinical suspicion is very high.  \n   \u2022 Organ involvement can be silent (e.g., kidney disease), so professional assessment is critical.\n\n6. What you can do now  \n   \u2022 Keep a symptom diary (when pains, rashes, fever, or other issues occur and what triggers them).  \n   \u2022 Gather personal and family medical history (autoimmune diseases often cluster in families).  \n   \u2022 Schedule a visit with your primary doctor or directly with a rheumatologist if suspicion is high.  \n   \u2022 Bring photos of rashes and a list of all medications and supplements.  \n   \u2022 Ask about sun protection, balanced diet, vitamin D, and smoking cessation, which can influence symptoms.\n\n7. When to seek urgent care  \n   \u2022 Sudden chest pain, severe shortness of breath, new seizures, stroke-like symptoms, rapid swelling in legs or face, or very dark/low urine output\u2014these can signal serious organ involvement and require emergency evaluation.\n\nBottom line  \nThere is no do-it-yourself test for lupus. Diagnosis is a step-by-step process that matches your symptoms with focused blood, urine, and sometimes imaging or biopsy studies, all interpreted by a qualified clinician\u2014usually a rheumatologist. If you suspect lupus, arrange an appointment rather than relying on over-the-counter test kits or internet checklists.",

Know the warning signs that should prompt a medical evaluation  \n   \u2022 Unusual, persistent fatigue  \n   \u2022 Joint pain, swelling, or morning stiffness lasting >30 minutes  \n   \u2022 Skin changes \u2013 especially a \u201cbutterfly\u201d (malar) rash across the cheeks and nose, or rashes that worsen in the sun  \n   \u2022 Fingers/toes that turn white or blue in the cold (Raynaud\u2019s)  \n   \u2022 Unexplained low-grade fevers, mouth or nose ulcers, hair loss, chest pain with deep breathing, shortness of breath, headaches, or brain-fog type symptoms  \n   \u2022 Swelling of the legs or around the eyes, dark or foamy urine (possible kidney involvement)\n\n   None of these is specific for lupus, but having several together\u2014especially in a woman of child-bearing age\u2014warrants evaluation.\n\n2. See a health-care professional (ideally a rheumatologist)  \n   There is no single \u201clupus test.\u201d Diagnosis is made by putting together:  \n   \u2022 Your history of symptoms and their pattern  \n   \u2022 A complete physical examination (skin, joints, heart, lungs, neurologic, etc.)  \n   \u2022 Laboratory and imaging studies  \n\n3. Tests commonly ordered  \n   Screening blood tests  \n   \u2022 Antinuclear antibody (ANA): positive in \u224895 % of people with lupus, but it can be positive in other conditions or even in healthy people. A negative ANA makes lupus unlikely, but not impossible.  \n   More specific antibody tests (done when ANA is positive or suspicion is high)  \n   \u2022 Anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA)  \n   \u2022 Anti-Smith (Sm)  \n   \u2022 Anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, antiphospholipid antibodies  \n   Other blood work  \n   \u2022 Complete blood count (looking for anemia, low white cells or platelets)  \n   \u2022 Comprehensive metabolic panel, creatinine, and complement levels (C3, C4)  \n   \u2022 Inflammation markers (ESR, CRP)  \n   Urine studies  \n   \u2022 Urinalysis and urine protein/creatinine ratio to detect kidney involvement  \n   Imaging or special tests (as needed)  \n   \u2022 Chest X-ray, echocardiogram, or CT if heart or lung involvement is suspected  \n   \u2022 Kidney biopsy, skin biopsy, or nerve/muscle studies if organ involvement needs confirmation\n\n4. Classification criteria your doctor may use  \n   The 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria require:  \n   \u2022 A positive ANA at least once, AND  \n   \u2022 Accumulation of \u226510 points from weighted clinical and immunologic features (joints, skin, kidney, blood counts, antibodies, etc.).  \n   These criteria are meant for research, but they help doctors organize the evidence.\n\n5. Why self-testing at home does not work  \n   \u2022 Symptoms overlap with many other disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, infections).  \n   \u2022 Lab tests must be interpreted in context; a positive ANA alone does not mean you have lupus, and a negative test does not rule it out if clinical suspicion is very high.  \n   \u2022 Organ involvement can be silent (e.g., kidney disease), so professional assessment is critical.\n\n6. What you can do now  \n   \u2022 Keep a symptom diary (when pains, rashes, fever, or other issues occur and what triggers them).  \n   \u2022 Gather personal and family medical history (autoimmune diseases often cluster in families).  \n   \u2022 Schedule a visit with your primary doctor or directly with a rheumatologist if suspicion is high.  \n   \u2022 Bring photos of rashes and a list of all medications and supplements.  \n   \u2022 Ask about sun protection, balanced diet, vitamin D, and smoking cessation, which can influence symptoms.\n\n7. When to seek urgent care  \n   \u2022 Sudden chest pain, severe shortness of breath, new seizures, stroke-like symptoms, rapid swelling in legs or face, or very dark/low urine output\u2014these can signal serious organ involvement and require emergency evaluation.\n\nBottom line  \nThere is no do-it-yourself test for lupus. Diagnosis is a step-by-step process that matches your symptoms with focused blood, urine, and sometimes imaging or biopsy studies, all interpreted by a qualified clinician\u2014usually a rheumatologist. If you suspect lupus, arrange an appointment rather than relying on over-the-counter test kits or internet checklists.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus): - Lupus can affect many body parts, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, or brain. - You will have periods of illness (flares) and wellness. - Anyone can get lupus, but it most often affects women.

Keep a symptom diary: when anxiety occurs, what you were doing, physical sensations, thoughts, behaviors, substances used, and how long it lasted.  \n2. Gather family and personal medical history and a list of medications/supplements.  \n3. Schedule an appointment with a primary-care clinician or mental-health specialist.  \n4. Bring a trusted friend/family member if you worry about expressing yourself.\n\nRemember: Only a qualified clinician can make or rule out an anxiety-disorder diagnosis and tailor treatment to your needs.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nAnxiety (Diagnosis): You may start by seeing your primary care doctor to find out if your anxiety could be related to your physical health. Your doctor can check for signs of an underlying medical condition that may need treatment. However, you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy). To help diagnose an anxiety disorder and rule out other conditions, your provider may: - Give you a psychological evaluation. This involves describing your thoughts, feelings and behavior to help pinpoint a diagnosis and check for related complications. Anxiety disorders often occur along with other mental health problems - such as depression or substance abuse - which can make diagnosis more challenging. - Compare your symptoms to the criteria in the DSM-5. Many doctors use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose an anxiety disorder.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The nerve or muscle is damaged by an outside factor.  \n   \u2022 Endocrine / metabolic diseases: Uncontrolled diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), thyroid disorders.  \n   \u2022 Infections: Poliovirus, West Nile virus, Lyme disease, HIV, shingles, some bacterial toxins (botulism).  \n   \u2022 Toxins / drugs: Lead, mercury, solvents, organophosphate pesticides, chronic alcohol use, certain chemotherapy agents, long-term or high-dose statins.  \n   \u2022 Trauma or compression: Car accidents, repetitive motion injuries, herniated discs, prolonged immobility.  \n   \u2022 Nutritional deficiencies: Severe lack of vitamin B1, B6, B12, vitamin E, copper.  \n\nKey points for consumers  \n\n\u2022 Most neuromuscular disorders are NOT contagious.  \n\u2022 Having a close relative with an inherited form raises your risk; genetic counseling can clarify chances before pregnancy.  \n\u2022 For autoimmune forms, a prior infection, another autoimmune disease, or certain tumors (e.g., thymoma) increase risk.  \n\u2022 Diligent control of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and thyroid disease lowers the chance of developing the neuropathic complications.  \n\u2022 Avoiding excessive alcohol, illicit drugs, heavy metals, and unnecessary exposure to pesticides/solvents decreases risk for toxic neuropathies.  \n\u2022 Prompt treatment of infections, attention to good nutrition, and safe workplace practices can prevent some acquired cases.  \n\nIf you notice persistent muscle weakness, wasting, twitching, numbness, tingling, or fatigue\u2014especially if it progresses\u2014see a health professional.  Early evaluation (history, exam, blood tests, EMG, genetic or antibody tests) can identify the specific cause and open the door to treatments such as immunotherapy, medications, physical therapy, assistive devices, and lifestyle adjustments.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nNeuromuscular Disorders (Summary): Summary Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves that control your voluntary muscles. Voluntary muscles are the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. Your nerve cells, also called neurons, send the messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die, communication between your nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result, your muscles weaken and waste away. The weakness can lead to twitching, cramps, aches and pains, and joint and movement problems. Sometimes it also affects heart function and your ability to breathe. Examples of neuromuscular disorders include - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Spinal muscular atrophy Many neuromuscular diseases are genetic, which means they run in families or there is a mutation in your genes. Sometimes, an immune system disorder can cause them. Most of them have no cure. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms, increase mobility and lengthen life.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\"\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Standard laboratory (lipid-panel) blood test  \n   \u2022 Where it\u2019s done: Doctor\u2019s office, clinic, hospital, many community laboratories.  \n   \u2022 What it measures:  \n     \u2013 Total cholesterol  \n     \u2013 LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol  \n     \u2013 HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol  \n     \u2013 Triglycerides  \n     \u2013 Sometimes non-HDL cholesterol and a calculated ratio.  \n   \u2022 How the sample is taken: A health-care professional draws a small tube of blood from a vein in your arm.  \n   \u2022 Fasting vs. non-fasting:  \n     \u2013 Traditional practice is to fast 9-12 hours beforehand (no food or drinks other than water) so triglycerides are not affected by a recent meal.  \n     \u2013 Many laboratories now accept non-fasting samples for routine screening; your clinician will tell you which they prefer.  \n   \u2022 Turn-around time: Results are usually ready within a few hours to a couple of days and are sent to your clinician, who will explain the numbers and any needed follow-up.\n\n2. Finger-stick (point-of-care) tests  \n   \u2022 Used in some doctor\u2019s offices, pharmacies, health fairs, and wellness programs.  \n   \u2022 A drop of blood from a fingertip is placed on a disposable strip inserted into a small analyzer.  \n   \u2022 Gives total cholesterol (and sometimes HDL, LDL, triglycerides) in about 5 minutes.  \n   \u2022 Less precise than a certified laboratory but useful for quick screening.\n\n3. Home cholesterol test kits  \n   \u2022 Available over-the-counter at pharmacies or online.  \n   \u2022 Two general types:  \n     \u2013 Mail-in kits: You place a finger-stick blood drop on a collection card and mail it to a certified lab; results come back in several days.  \n     \u2013 Instant-read electronic meters: Similar to home glucose monitors; give immediate results.  \n   \u2022 Look for kits that are FDA-cleared and carry the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN) accuracy certification.  \n   \u2022 Still advisable to confirm abnormal or borderline results with your health-care provider.\n\nHow often should you test?  \n\u2022 Adults 20 years and older with no risk factors: every 4\u20136 years.  \n\u2022 Men \u226545 and women \u226555, or anyone with cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, family history, obesity): as often as your clinician recommends (often yearly).  \n\u2022 Children: once between ages 9\u201311 and again between 17\u201321, or earlier/more often if they have risk factors (obesity, diabetes, strong family history).\n\nPreparing for the test  \n\u2022 If fasting is required: stop eating and drinking anything except water for 9\u201312 hours before the blood draw; continue to take prescribed medicines unless instructed otherwise.  \n\u2022 Drink water so veins are easier to access.  \n\u2022 Bring a list of all medications and supplements you take.\n\nInterpreting the numbers (general adult targets)  \n\u2022 Total cholesterol: <200 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L) desirable.  \n\u2022 LDL: <100 mg/dL (<70 mg/dL if you already have heart disease or diabetes).  \n\u2022 HDL: \u226540 mg/dL in men, \u226550 mg/dL in women; higher is better.  \n\u2022 Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL.  \nYour clinician will interpret these in the context of your overall cardiovascular risk and decide whether lifestyle changes, further testing, or medication (e.g., statins) are warranted.\n\nSafety and reliability tips  \n\u2022 Always use a reputable laboratory or an FDA-cleared test kit.  \n\u2022 Calibrate home meters as instructed and check expiration dates on test strips.  \n\u2022 Abnormal results should be confirmed by a laboratory lipid panel.  \n\u2022 Never adjust or stop prescribed medication based solely on a home reading without consulting your health-care professional.\n\nBottom line  \nThe most accurate, comprehensive way to learn your cholesterol levels is a fasting (or clinician-directed non-fasting) lipid-panel blood test taken at a medical facility, but quick finger-stick and home tests can provide useful screening information. Discuss the results and appropriate follow-up with your health-care provider.",

Standard laboratory (lipid-panel) blood test  \n   \u2022 Where it\u2019s done: Doctor\u2019s office, clinic, hospital, many community laboratories.  \n   \u2022 What it measures:  \n     \u2013 Total cholesterol  \n     \u2013 LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol  \n     \u2013 HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol  \n     \u2013 Triglycerides  \n     \u2013 Sometimes non-HDL cholesterol and a calculated ratio.  \n   \u2022 How the sample is taken: A health-care professional draws a small tube of blood from a vein in your arm.  \n   \u2022 Fasting vs. non-fasting:  \n     \u2013 Traditional practice is to fast 9-12 hours beforehand (no food or drinks other than water) so triglycerides are not affected by a recent meal.  \n     \u2013 Many laboratories now accept non-fasting samples for routine screening; your clinician will tell you which they prefer.  \n   \u2022 Turn-around time: Results are usually ready within a few hours to a couple of days and are sent to your clinician, who will explain the numbers and any needed follow-up.\n\n2. Finger-stick (point-of-care) tests  \n   \u2022 Used in some doctor\u2019s offices, pharmacies, health fairs, and wellness programs.  \n   \u2022 A drop of blood from a fingertip is placed on a disposable strip inserted into a small analyzer.  \n   \u2022 Gives total cholesterol (and sometimes HDL, LDL, triglycerides) in about 5 minutes.  \n   \u2022 Less precise than a certified laboratory but useful for quick screening.\n\n3. Home cholesterol test kits  \n   \u2022 Available over-the-counter at pharmacies or online.  \n   \u2022 Two general types:  \n     \u2013 Mail-in kits: You place a finger-stick blood drop on a collection card and mail it to a certified lab; results come back in several days.  \n     \u2013 Instant-read electronic meters: Similar to home glucose monitors; give immediate results.  \n   \u2022 Look for kits that are FDA-cleared and carry the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN) accuracy certification.  \n   \u2022 Still advisable to confirm abnormal or borderline results with your health-care provider.\n\nHow often should you test?  \n\u2022 Adults 20 years and older with no risk factors: every 4\u20136 years.  \n\u2022 Men \u226545 and women \u226555, or anyone with cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, family history, obesity): as often as your clinician recommends (often yearly).  \n\u2022 Children: once between ages 9\u201311 and again between 17\u201321, or earlier/more often if they have risk factors (obesity, diabetes, strong family history).\n\nPreparing for the test  \n\u2022 If fasting is required: stop eating and drinking anything except water for 9\u201312 hours before the blood draw; continue to take prescribed medicines unless instructed otherwise.  \n\u2022 Drink water so veins are easier to access.  \n\u2022 Bring a list of all medications and supplements you take.\n\nInterpreting the numbers (general adult targets)  \n\u2022 Total cholesterol: <200 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L) desirable.  \n\u2022 LDL: <100 mg/dL (<70 mg/dL if you already have heart disease or diabetes).  \n\u2022 HDL: \u226540 mg/dL in men, \u226550 mg/dL in women; higher is better.  \n\u2022 Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL.  \nYour clinician will interpret these in the context of your overall cardiovascular risk and decide whether lifestyle changes, further testing, or medication (e.g., statins) are warranted.\n\nSafety and reliability tips  \n\u2022 Always use a reputable laboratory or an FDA-cleared test kit.  \n\u2022 Calibrate home meters as instructed and check expiration dates on test strips.  \n\u2022 Abnormal results should be confirmed by a laboratory lipid panel.  \n\u2022 Never adjust or stop prescribed medication based solely on a home reading without consulting your health-care professional.\n\nBottom line  \nThe most accurate, comprehensive way to learn your cholesterol levels is a fasting (or clinician-directed non-fasting) lipid-panel blood test taken at a medical facility, but quick finger-stick and home tests can provide useful screening information. Discuss the results and appropriate follow-up with your health-care provider.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHigh cholesterol (Diagnosis): A blood test to check cholesterol levels - called a lipid panel or lipid profile - typically reports: - Total cholesterol - LDL cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - Triglycerides - a type of fat in the blood For the most accurate measurements, don't eat or drink anything (other than water) for nine to 12 hours before the blood sample is taken. Interpreting the numbers In the United States, cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. In Canada and many European countries, cholesterol levels are measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To interpret your test results, use these general guidelines. Children and cholesterol testing For most children, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends one cholesterol screening test between the ages of 9 and 11, and another cholesterol screening test between the ages of 17 and 21. Cholesterol testing is usually avoided between the ages of 12 and 16 because false-negative results are more likely within this age group. If your child has a family history of early-onset heart disease or a personal history of obesity or diabetes, your doctor may recommend earlier or more frequent cholesterol testing.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Call for emergency help first  \n   \u2022 If you or someone nearby has chest pain, shortness of breath, or other heart-attack symptoms, dial 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately. Do NOT drive yourself to the hospital unless there is absolutely no alternative.\n\n2. What happens on the way to\u2014and in\u2014the hospital  \n   \u2022 Paramedics give oxygen, aspirin to chew, and often nitroglycerin to relieve chest pain and limit heart muscle damage.  \n   \u2022 They transmit an electrocardiogram (ECG) while en route so the hospital cardiology team is ready when you arrive.\n\n3. Emergency hospital treatments  \n   A. Medications  \n      \u2013 Antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) keep new clots from forming.  \n      \u2013 Anticoagulants (heparin) thin the blood further.  \n      \u2013 Nitroglycerin widens coronary arteries and eases pain.  \n      \u2013 Morphine or other pain relievers as needed.  \n      \u2013 Beta-blockers lower heart rate and blood pressure.  \n      \u2013 ACE inhibitors or ARBs help the heart pump more efficiently.  \n      \u2013 Statins start right away to stabilize plaque and lower cholesterol.  \n\n   B.

Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home.

Peak-flow monitoring, challenge tests, and exams for allergies or inflammation help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nAsthma (Diagnosis): Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma\u2014that is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on. You may need to see an asthma specialist if: You need special tests to help diagnose asthma You've had a life-threatening asthma attack You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled You're thinking about getting allergy treatments Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to \"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\" Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. Diagnostic Tests Lung Function Test Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include: Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old. A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: One or both parents have asthma The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. Doctors also may use a 4\u20136 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

This is called a gram stain. This method is fast, but it is not the most certain. Gonorrhea is most accurately detected with DNA tests. DNA tests are useful for screening. The ligase chain reaction (LCR) test is one of the tests. DNA tests are quicker than cultures. These tests can be performed on urine samples, which are easier to collect than samples from the genital area. Prior to DNA tests, cultures (cells that grow in a lab dish) were used to provide proof of gonorrhea, but are less commonly used now. Samples for a culture are most often taken from the cervix, vagina, urethra, anus, or throat. - Rarely they are taken from joint fluid or blood - Cultures can often provide an early diagnosis within 24 hours. A confirmed diagnosis is available within 72 hours. If you have gonorrhea, you should ask to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV herpes and hepatitis.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. Overview Hemophilia usually is inherited. \"Inherited\u201d means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. People born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrow\u2014a sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. The two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9). Rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \"Acquired\u201d means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. This article focuses on inherited hemophilia. Outlook Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. People who don't have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than\u00a0 1 percent. Hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year. Hemophilia A Classic hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency Hemophilia B Christmas disease Factor IX deficiency A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz). Chromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors. A male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \"hemophilia carrier\u201d and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding. Very rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females. Some males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren't carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child. Below are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 1 Each daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 2 Each daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia. The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Excessive Bleeding The extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is. Children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision. Bleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding). Signs of external bleeding may include: Bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth Nosebleeds for no obvious reason Heavy bleeding from a minor cut Bleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time Signs of internal bleeding may include: Blood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder) Blood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach) Large bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body) Bleeding in the Joints Bleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury. At first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend. Swelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint. Bleeding in the Brain Internal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include: Long-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or changes in behavior Sudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease. You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out: How long it takes for your blood to clot Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is. Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia. Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults. The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different. Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies. Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have \"preimplantation diagnosis\" to have children who don't have hemophilia. For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb. Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at home\u2014it only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include: Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working. These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 20\u201330 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 2\u20135 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to: Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: \u00a0 Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages: You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \"Living With Hemophilia\u201d). Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You? The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having. Mild hemophilia\u2014Replacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophilia\u2014You may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophilia\u2014You usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment. If you or your child has hemophilia, you can take steps to prevent bleeding problems. Thanks to improvements in treatment, a child who has hemophilia today is likely to live a normal lifespan. Hemophilia Treatment Centers The Federal Government funds a nationwide network of hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). These centers are an important resource for people who have hemophilia and their families. The medical experts at HTCs provide treatment, education, and support. They can teach you or your family members how to do home treatments. Center staff also can provide your doctor with information. People who get care at HTCs are less likely than those who get care elsewhere to have bleeding complications and hospitalizations. They're also more likely to have a better quality of life. This may be due to the centers' emphasis on bleeding prevention and the education and support provided to patients and their caregivers. More than 100 federally funded HTCs are located throughout the United States. Many HTCs are located at major university medical and research centers. The hemophilia teams at these centers include: Nurse coordinators Pediatricians (doctors who treat children) and adult and pediatric hematologists (doctors who specialize in blood disorders) Social workers (who can help with financial issues, transportation, mental health, and other issues) Physical therapists and orthopedists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the bones and joints) Dentists To find an HTC located near you, go to the directory of HTCs on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site. Many people who have hemophilia go to HTCs for annual checkups, even if it means traveling some distance to do so. At an HTC, you or your child may be able to take part in clinical research and benefit from the latest hemophilia research findings. The HTC team also will work with your local health care providers to help meet your needs or your child's needs. Ongoing Care If you have hemophilia, you can take steps to avoid complications. For example: Follow your treatment plan exactly as your doctor prescribes. Have regular checkups and vaccinations as recommended. Tell all of your health care providers\u2014such as your doctor, dentist, and pharmacist\u2014that you have hemophilia. You also may want to tell people like your employee health nurse, gym trainer, and sports coach about your condition. Have regular dental care. Dentists at the HTCs are experts in providing dental care for people who have hemophilia. If you see another dentist, tell him or her that you have hemophilia. The dentist can provide medicine that will reduce bleeding during dental work. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding in joints and other parts of the body. Know when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. For example, you'll need care if you have: - Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. - Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. - Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. It's a good idea to keep a record of all previous treatments. Be sure to take this information with you to medical appointments and to the hospital or emergency room. If Your Child Is Diagnosed With Hemophilia You may have emotional, financial, social, or other strains as you adjust to having a child who has hemophilia. Learn all you can about the disorder and get the support you need. Talk with doctors and other health care providers about treatment, prevention of bleeding, and what to do during an emergency. The care teams at HTCs can provide your child with treatment and help educate and support you. The social worker on the team can help with emotional issues, financial and transportation problems, and other concerns. Seek the many resources available through the Web, books, and other materials, including those provided by national and local hemophilia organizations. Look into support groups that offer a variety of activities for children who have hemophilia and for family members. Some groups offer summer camps for children who have hemophilia. Ask your doctor, nurse coordinator, or social worker about these groups and camps. Challenges will occur as your child grows and becomes more active. In addition to treatment and regular health and dental care, your child needs information about hemophilia that he or she can understand. Children who have hemophilia also need ongoing support, and they need to be reassured that the condition isn't their fault. Young children who have hemophilia need extra protection from things in the home and elsewhere that could cause injuries and bleeding: Protect toddlers with kneepads, elbow pads, and protective helmets. All children should wear safety helmets when riding tricycles or bicycles. Be sure to use the safety belts and straps in highchairs, car seats, and strollers to protect your child from falls. Remove furniture with sharp corners or pad them while your child is a toddler. Keep out of reach or locked away small and sharp objects and other items that could cause bleeding or harm. Check play equipment and outdoor play areas for possible hazards. You also should learn how to examine your child for and recognize signs of bleeding. Learn to prepare for bleeding episodes when they occur. Keep a cold pack in the freezer ready to use as directed or to take along with you to treat bumps and bruises. Popsicles work fine when there is minor bleeding in the mouth. You also might want to keep a bag ready to go with items you'll need if you must take your child to the emergency room or elsewhere. Be sure that anyone who is responsible for your child knows that he or she has hemophilia. Talk with your child's babysitters, daycare providers, teachers, other school staff, and coaches or leaders of afterschool activities about when to contact you or to call 9\u20131\u20131 for emergency care. Your child should wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace. If your child is injured, the ID will alert anyone caring for your child about his or her hemophilia. Physical Activity and Hemophilia Physical activity helps keep muscles flexible, strengthens joints, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Children and adults who have hemophilia should be physically active, but they may have limits on what they can do safely. People who have mild hemophilia can take part in many activities. Those who have severe hemophilia should avoid contact sports and other activities that are likely to lead to injuries that could cause bleeding. Examples of these activities include football, hockey, and wrestling. Physical therapists at HTCs can develop exercise programs tailored to your needs and teach you how to exercise safely. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about recommended types of physical activity and sports. In general, some safe physical activities are swimming, biking (wearing a helmet), walking, and golf. To prevent bleeding, you also may be able to take clotting factors prior to exercise or a sporting event. Medicine Precautions Some medicines increase the risk of bleeding, such as: Aspirin and other medicines that contain salicylates (sa-LIH-sil-ates) Ibuprofen, naproxen, and some other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Treatment at Home and When Traveling Home treatment with replacement therapy has many benefits. It lets you treat bleeding early, before complications are likely to develop. Home treatment also can prevent frequent trips to the doctor's office or hospital. This can give you more independence and control over your hemophilia. However, if you're treating yourself or your child with clotting factors at home, you should take some steps for safety: Follow instructions for storage, preparation, and use of clotting factors and treatment materials. Keep a record of all medical treatment. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding, infection, or an allergic reaction, and know the correct way to respond. Have someone with you when you treat yourself. Know when to call the doctor or 9\u20131\u20131. When you're traveling, be sure to take enough treatment supplies along. You also should carry a letter from your doctor describing your hemophilia and treatment. It's a good idea to find out in advance where to go for care when out of town. Cost Issues Clotting factors are very costly. Many health insurance companies will only pay for clotting factors on a case-by-case basis. It's important to know: What your insurance covers Whether your insurance has a limit on the dollar amount it will cover and what that amount is Whether restrictions or waiting periods apply As children grow, it's important to learn about available options for insurance. Look into what kinds of health insurance are offered when seeking a job.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone. Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called translocation. Other signs include: - Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye (coloboma) - Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle (diastasis recti) - Umbilical hernia or inguinal hernia There are often signs of congenital heart disease, such as: - Atrial septal defect (ASD) - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Tests may also show kidney problems, including: - Horseshoe kidney - Hydronephrosis - Polycystic kidney\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

They are given through shots in or around the spine. The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist. First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic. You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly. For an epidural: - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space. - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth. - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure. For a spinal: - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed. - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures. Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). People usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk. Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures. Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when: - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine. - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet. - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure. - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications: - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma) - Difficulty urinating - Drop in blood pressure - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess) - Nerve damage - Seizures (this is rare) - Severe headache Tell your health care provider: - If you are or could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the procedure: - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before. - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinners. - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure. - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic. - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. On the day of the procedure: - Follow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking. - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure. - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. - Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours. This is to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

    "predicted_text": "How epilepsy is diagnosed\n\n1. Detailed history and description of the spells  \n   \u2022 Your doctor (often a neurologist) will ask you and anyone who has seen your episodes to describe exactly what happens before, during, and after an event: body movements, awareness, length of time, triggers, recovery, injuries, aura (warning sensations), and possible provoking factors such as lack of sleep, fever, or alcohol.  \n   \u2022 A seizure diary\u2014dates, times, and circumstances of each spell\u2014can be very helpful.\n\n2. Medical and family history & physical/neurologic examination  \n   \u2022 Questions about past illnesses, head injuries, infections, medications, substance use, pregnancy, and family members with seizures.  \n   \u2022 A neurologic exam tests strength, reflexes, coordination, sensation, and mental status.\n\n3. Electroencephalogram (EEG)  \n   \u2022 Small electrodes placed on the scalp record the brain\u2019s electrical activity.  \n   \u2022 Certain abnormal patterns (spikes or sharp waves) strongly suggest a tendency for seizures.  \n   \u2022 A routine EEG lasts 20-40 minutes; \u201csleep-deprived\u201d or prolonged recordings, including video-EEG monitoring (hours to several days in an epilepsy monitoring unit), may be ordered if the routine EEG is normal but suspicion remains high.\n\n4. Brain imaging  \n   \u2022 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred scan. It can detect scar tissue, tumors, malformations, strokes, or other structural problems that can cause epilepsy.  \n   \u2022 Computed tomography (CT) may be used if MRI is not available or in emergencies.  \n   \u2022 Less common studies, such as PET or SPECT scans, help in difficult cases or before surgery.\n\n5. Blood and other laboratory tests  \n   \u2022 To look for infections, metabolic or genetic conditions that can provoke seizures and to guide treatment.\n\n6. Additional cardiac or metabolic studies when needed  \n   \u2022 Sometimes fainting, heart-rhythm disturbances, migraines, sleep disorders, or psychological conditions mimic seizures. Tests such as ECG, tilt-table study, or sleep studies can help rule these out.\n\nDiagnostic criteria  \n\u2022 Typically, epilepsy is diagnosed after:  \n  \u2013 Two unprovoked seizures occurring at least 24 hours apart, or  \n  \u2013 One unprovoked seizure plus evidence (from EEG, imaging, or strong clinical factors) that the risk of another seizure is high (\u226560 % over the next 10 years), or  \n  \u2013 A known epilepsy syndrome (e.g., childhood absence epilepsy) identified by characteristic EEG and clinical features.\n\nWhy accuracy matters  \nConfirming epilepsy\u2014vs. a single provoked seizure or another condition\u2014guides whether lifelong medication, further testing, or possible surgery is appropriate.\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve had a seizure  \n\u2022 Seek medical attention promptly.  \n\u2022 Bring a witness if possible, or share phone videos of the event.  \n\u2022 Keep a seizure diary and list all medications and supplements.  \n\u2022 Do not stop or start medicines without consulting your doctor.\n\nRemember: Only a qualified health professional can diagnose epilepsy. If you or someone you care for is experiencing possible seizures, schedule an evaluation as soon as possible.",

Detailed history and description of the spells  \n   \u2022 Your doctor (often a neurologist) will ask you and anyone who has seen your episodes to describe exactly what happens before, during, and after an event: body movements, awareness, length of time, triggers, recovery, injuries, aura (warning sensations), and possible provoking factors such as lack of sleep, fever, or alcohol.  \n   \u2022 A seizure diary\u2014dates, times, and circumstances of each spell\u2014can be very helpful.\n\n2. Medical and family history & physical/neurologic examination  \n   \u2022 Questions about past illnesses, head injuries, infections, medications, substance use, pregnancy, and family members with seizures.  \n   \u2022 A neurologic exam tests strength, reflexes, coordination, sensation, and mental status.\n\n3. Electroencephalogram (EEG)  \n   \u2022 Small electrodes placed on the scalp record the brain\u2019s electrical activity.  \n   \u2022 Certain abnormal patterns (spikes or sharp waves) strongly suggest a tendency for seizures.  \n   \u2022 A routine EEG lasts 20-40 minutes; \u201csleep-deprived\u201d or prolonged recordings, including video-EEG monitoring (hours to several days in an epilepsy monitoring unit), may be ordered if the routine EEG is normal but suspicion remains high.\n\n4. Brain imaging  \n   \u2022 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred scan. It can detect scar tissue, tumors, malformations, strokes, or other structural problems that can cause epilepsy.  \n   \u2022 Computed tomography (CT) may be used if MRI is not available or in emergencies.  \n   \u2022 Less common studies, such as PET or SPECT scans, help in difficult cases or before surgery.\n\n5. Blood and other laboratory tests  \n   \u2022 To look for infections, metabolic or genetic conditions that can provoke seizures and to guide treatment.\n\n6. Additional cardiac or metabolic studies when needed  \n   \u2022 Sometimes fainting, heart-rhythm disturbances, migraines, sleep disorders, or psychological conditions mimic seizures. Tests such as ECG, tilt-table study, or sleep studies can help rule these out.\n\nDiagnostic criteria  \n\u2022 Typically, epilepsy is diagnosed after:  \n  \u2013 Two unprovoked seizures occurring at least 24 hours apart, or  \n  \u2013 One unprovoked seizure plus evidence (from EEG, imaging, or strong clinical factors) that the risk of another seizure is high (\u226560 % over the next 10 years), or  \n  \u2013 A known epilepsy syndrome (e.g., childhood absence epilepsy) identified by characteristic EEG and clinical features.\n\nWhy accuracy matters  \nConfirming epilepsy\u2014vs. a single provoked seizure or another condition\u2014guides whether lifelong medication, further testing, or possible surgery is appropriate.\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve had a seizure  \n\u2022 Seek medical attention promptly.  \n\u2022 Bring a witness if possible, or share phone videos of the event.  \n\u2022 Keep a seizure diary and list all medications and supplements.  \n\u2022 Do not stop or start medicines without consulting your doctor.\n\nRemember: Only a qualified health professional can diagnose epilepsy. If you or someone you care for is experiencing possible seizures, schedule an evaluation as soon as possible.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nEpilepsy - overview (Exams and Tests): The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with epilepsy often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, you may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for days or weeks as you go about your everyday life. - Stay in a special hospital where brain activity can be recorded while video cameras capture what happens to you during the seizure. This is called video EEG. Tests that may be done include: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan is often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen. If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children. Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child. Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops. The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water. Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child's pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days. Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The dose of oxazepam (Serax) that can lead to dangerous toxicity depends on several factors:\n\n\u2022 The usual prescribed range is 10\u201330 mg taken 3-4 times a day (roughly 30\u2013120 mg in 24 h).  \n\u2022 People who are elderly, have lung or liver disease, or are taking other medicines that slow the brain (alcohol, opioids, sleeping pills, other benzodiazepines, some antidepressants, antihistamines, etc.) can develop life-threatening sedation or slowed breathing at or only slightly above the normal dose.  \n\u2022 In otherwise healthy adults, serious symptoms most often appear when several hundred milligrams are taken at once (for example, 300\u2013600 mg or more), but reports show wide variation\u2014some people develop severe coma at lower doses, and others survive much higher amounts.  \n\u2022 When oxazepam is combined with alcohol or opioids, a dose only slightly above the therapeutic range can be fatal.\n\nWarning signs of overdose  \n\u2022 Extreme sleepiness or inability to stay awake  \n\u2022 Confusion, slurred speech  \n\u2022 Poor or absent reflexes, loss of balance  \n\u2022 Slow or shallow breathing, bluish lips or fingers  \n\u2022 Loss of consciousness or unresponsiveness\n\nWhat to do  \n\u2022 If you suspect an overdose or see any of the symptoms above, call 911 immediately.  \n\u2022 If the person is awake but you think too much was taken, call Poison Control (U.S. 1-800-222-1222) or your local emergency number for instructions.  \n\u2022 Do not try to make the person vomit unless told to do so by medical professionals.\n\nBottom line  \nBecause individual susceptibility varies so widely, any dose larger than prescribed\u2014or any amount taken with alcohol, opioids, or other sedatives\u2014should be treated as a potential overdose and requires immediate medical help.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat is Oxazepam overdose?: Oxazepam is a medicine used to treat anxiety and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

Nicotine dependence means you can't stop using the substance, even though it's causing you harm. Nicotine produces physical and mood-altering effects in your brain that are temporarily pleasing. These effects make you want to use tobacco and lead to dependence. At the same time, stopping tobacco use causes withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and anxiety. While it's the nicotine in tobacco that causes nicotine dependence, the toxic effects of tobacco result from other substances in tobacco. Smokers have much higher rates of heart disease, stroke and cancer than nonsmokers do. Regardless of how long you've smoked, stopping smoking can improve your health. Many effective treatments for nicotine dependence are available to help you manage withdrawal and stop smoking for good. Ask your doctor for help. For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: - You can't stop smoking. You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. - You experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. - You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. - You give up social or recreational activities in order to smoke. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with certain family members or friends because you can't smoke in these locations or situations. You're not alone if you've tried to stop smoking but haven't been able to stop for good. Most smokers make many attempts to stop smoking before they achieve stable, long-term abstinence from smoking. You're more likely to stop for good if you follow a treatment plan that addresses both the physical and the behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. Using medications and working with a counselor specially trained to help people stop smoking (a tobacco treatment specialist) will significantly boost your chances of success. Ask your doctor, counselor or therapist to help you develop a treatment plan that works for you or to advise you on where to get help to stop smoking. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine is very addictive when delivered by inhaling tobacco smoke into the lungs, which quickly releases nicotine into the blood allowing it to get into the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help regulate mood and behavior. Dopamine, one of these neurotransmitters, is released in the \"reward center\" of the brain and causes improved mood and feelings of pleasure. Experiencing these effects from nicotine is what makes tobacco so addictive. Nicotine dependence involves behavioral (routines, habits, feelings) as well as physical factors. These behavioral associations with smoking may act as triggers - situations or feelings that activate a craving for tobacco, even if you have not smoked for some time. Behaviors and cues that you may associate with smoking include: - Certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, with morning coffee or during breaks at work - After a meal - Drinking alcohol - Certain places or friends - Talking on the phone - Stressful situations or when you're feeling down - Sight or smell of a burning cigarette - Driving your car To overcome your dependence on tobacco, you need to become aware of your triggers and develop a plan to deal with the behaviors and routines that you associate with smoking. Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who will use tobacco include: - Genetics. The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited - genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain's nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes. - Home and peer influence. Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke also are more likely to try cigarettes. Evidence suggests that smoking shown in movies and on the Internet can encourage young people to smoke. - Age. Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you'll become a heavy smoker as an adult. - Depression or other mental illness. Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers. - Substance use. People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 known cancer-causing chemicals and thousands of other harmful substances. Even \"all natural\" or herbal cigarettes have chemicals that are harmful to your health. Smoking harms almost every organ of your body and impairs your body's immune system. About half of all regular smokers will die of a disease caused by tobacco. Women smokers are now at equal risk to men smokers of dying from lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease caused by using tobacco. The negative health effects include: - Lung cancer and other lung diseases. Smoking causes nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancer cases. In addition, smoking causes other lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse. - Other cancers. Smoking is a major cause of cancers of the esophagus, larynx, throat (pharynx) and mouth and is related to cancers of the bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix, and some leukemias. Overall, smoking causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths. - Heart and circulatory system problems. Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attack and stroke. Even smoking just one to four cigarettes daily increases your risk of heart disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition. However, stopping smoking reduces your risk of having a heart attack by 50 percent in the first year. - Diabetes. Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for the development of type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems. - Eye problems. Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration. - Infertility and impotence. Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men. - Pregnancy and newborn complications. Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, lower birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in their newborns. - Cold, flu and other illnesses. Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. - Weakened senses. Smoking deadens your senses of taste and smell, so food isn't as appetizing. - Teeth and gum disease. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammation of the gum (gingivitis) and a serious gum infection that can destroy the support system for teeth (periodontitis). - Physical appearance. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can change the structure of your skin, causing premature aging and wrinkles. Smoking also yellows your teeth, fingers and fingernails. - Risks to your family. Nonsmoking spouses and partners of smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don't live with a smoker. If you smoke, your children will be more prone to SIDS, worsening asthma, ear infections and colds. Your doctor may ask you questions or have you complete a questionnaire to get a sense of how dependent you are on nicotine. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after awakening, the more dependent you are. Knowing your degree of dependence will help your doctor determine the best treatment plan for you. Like most smokers, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt - especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to stop if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination. Medications Many treatments, including nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, have been approved as safe and effective in treating nicotine dependence. Using more than one medication may help you get better results. For example, combining a longer acting medication with a short-acting nicotine replacement product may be beneficial. Talk to your health care provider about the right treatment for you. If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, you smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, or you're under age 18, talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter nicotine replacement products. Nicotine replacement therapy Nicotine replacement therapy gives you nicotine without tobacco and the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Nicotine replacement products help relieve withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The best time to start using nicotine replacement medication is on the date you've set to stop smoking. Some smokers start earlier in order to reduce smoking on their way to stopping altogether. The following nicotine replacement products are available over-the-counter: - Nicotine patch (NicoDerm CQ, Habitrol, others). The patch delivers nicotine through your skin and into your bloodstream. You wear a new patch each day. You typically use the patch for eight weeks or longer. If you haven't been able to stop smoking completely after two weeks of wearing the patch, ask your doctor about adjusting the dose or adding another nicotine replacement product. Common side effects include skin irritation, insomnia and vivid dreams. - Nicotine gum (Nicorette, others). This gum delivers nicotine to your blood through the lining of your mouth. Nicotine gum is often recommended to curb cravings. Chew the gum for a few times until you feel a mild tingling or peppery taste, then park the gum between your cheek and gumline for several minutes. This chewing and parking allows nicotine to be gradually absorbed in your bloodstream. Mouth irritation is a common side effect. Other side effects are often a result of overly vigorous chewing that releases nicotine too quickly. These include heartburn, nausea and hiccups. - Nicotine lozenge (Commit, Nicorette mini lozenge, others). This lozenge dissolves in your mouth and, like nicotine gum, delivers nicotine through the lining of your mouth. Place the lozenge in your mouth between your gumline and cheek or under your tongue and allow it to dissolve. You'll start with one lozenge every one to two hours and gradually increase the time between lozenges. Avoid drinking anything right before, while using or right after the lozenge. Side effects include mouth irritation as well as nicotine-related effects such as heartburn, nausea and hiccups. These nicotine replacement products are available by prescription: - Nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS). The nicotine in this product, sprayed directly into each nostril, is absorbed through your nasal membranes into your blood vessels. The nasal spray delivers nicotine a bit quicker than gum, lozenges or the patch, but not as rapidly as smoking a cigarette. It's usually prescribed for three-month periods for up to six months. Nasal and throat irritation, runny nose, sneezing and coughing are common side effects. - Nicotine inhaler (Nicotrol). This device is shaped something like a cigarette holder. You puff on it, and it delivers nicotine vapor into your mouth. You absorb the nicotine through the lining in your mouth, where it then enters your bloodstream. Common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and occasional coughing. Non-nicotine medications Medications that don't contain nicotine and are available by prescription include: - Bupropion (Zyban). The antidepressant drug bupropion increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, brain chemicals that are also boosted by nicotine. Typically your doctor will advise you to start bupropion one week before you stop smoking. Bupropion has the advantage of helping to minimize weight gain after you quit smoking. Common side effects include insomnia, agitation, headache and dry mouth. If you have a history of seizures or serious head trauma, such as a skull fracture, you shouldn't take this drug. - Varenicline (Chantix). This medication acts on the brain's nicotine receptors, decreasing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the feelings of pleasure you get from smoking. Typically your doctor will advise you to start varenicline one week before you stop smoking. Common side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia and vivid dreams. Rarely, varenicline has been associated with serious psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. - Nortriptyline (Pamelor). This medication may be prescribed if other medications haven't helped. This tricyclic antidepressant acts by increasing the levels of the brain neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Common side effects may include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation. Counseling, support groups and other programs Combining medications with behavioral counseling provides the best chance for establishing long-term smoking abstinence. Medications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms including tobacco craving, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to avoid tobacco over the long run. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be. Several types of counseling and support can help with stopping smoking: - Telephone counseling. No matter where you live, you can take advantage of phone counseling to help you give up tobacco. Every state in the U.S. has a telephone quit line, and some have more than one. To find the options in your state, call 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669). - Individual or group counseling program. Your doctor may recommend local support groups or a treatment program where counseling is provided by a tobacco treatment specialist. Counseling helps you learn techniques for preparing to stop smoking and provides support for you during the process. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs or have tobacco treatment specialists who are certified to provide treatment for nicotine dependence. Nicotine Anonymous groups are available in many locations to provide support for smokers trying to quit. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs - the most intensive treatment available. - Internet-based programs. Several websites offer support and strategies for people who want to stop smoking. BecomeAnEX is free and provides information and techniques as well as blogs, community forums, ask the expert and many other features. Text messaging services, including personalized reminders about a quit-smoking plan, also may prove helpful. Methods to avoid It's not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for cigarette smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe. Even products that deliver nicotine without tobacco are risky. Stick with proven stop-smoking aids and steer clear of the following products: - Dissolvable tobacco products. Tobacco pouches, lozenges, strips or other products contain small amounts of tobacco and nicotine you hold or dissolve in your mouth. There is no evidence they will help you stop smoking and little is known about their health effects. - E-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices that heat liquid containing nicotine into a vapor to be inhaled. Because these products are new, there isn't much data about possible safety risks. Studies of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation have shown mixed results. For these reasons, e-cigarettes aren't recommended for people trying to quit smoking. - Flavored cigarettes. Clove cigarettes (kreteks) and flavored cigarettes (bidis) carry the same health risks as smoking regular cigarettes and can cause additional health problems. Although they're banned in the United States, flavored cigarettes are available in other countries. - Hookahs (narghiles). These are water pipes that burn tobacco, and the smoke is inhaled through a hose. They are not safer than cigarettes. The water does not filter out toxins in the smoke, and the water and pipe have a risk of transmitting infections. - Nicotine lollipops and balms. Products containing nicotine salicylate are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and they pose a risk for accidental use by children. - Pipes and cigars. These products have similar, though less frequent, health risks as cigarettes, and they are not a safe alternative. - Smokeless tobacco and snuff (snus). These products contain nicotine in amounts similar to cigarettes and increase your risk of mouth and throat cancer, tooth and gum diseases, and other health problems. It's important to have a plan for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms are usually the most intense during the first week after you stop smoking. They may continue for several weeks, with declining intensity. Although most nicotine withdrawal symptoms pass within a month, you may occasionally experience a strong urge or craving to smoke months after stopping. Triggers or cues that were associated with your smoking can provoke these urges or cravings. Here's what you can do to help manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Regular physical activity has been found to reduce withdrawal symptoms and help people stop smoking. Exercise also helps avoid potential weight gain often associated with stopping. - Wait out cravings. Cravings or urges usually last less than five minutes. Wash the dishes, go for a walk or have a healthy snack, such as carrots, an apple or sunflower seeds, which will keep your mouth busy. Do something that keeps your hands busy, and before you know it, the urge will have passed. This is why you want to get rid of tobacco supplies when you decide to quit. You don't want to have any on hand when a craving hits. - Identify rationalizations. If you find yourself thinking, \"I'll just smoke one to get through this tough time\" or \"Just one won't hurt,\" recognize it as a message that can derail your plan. Review your reasons for quitting, and replace that thought with something positive to support your stopping. - Talk to a support person. If you're feeling anxious or depressed or need encouragement, a support person can help you get through a difficult craving. - Avoid high-risk situations. Know your triggers, and stay away from people, places and situations that tempt you to smoke. - Eat regular, healthy meals. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink more water. Many products claim to be smoking-cessation aids. Many also claim to be \"natural.\" Just remember that \"natural\" doesn't necessarily mean \"safe.\" Talk with your doctor before trying any alternative medicine treatments. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture involves stimulating points on the body, typically with thin, solid, metallic needles. Several studies have been conducted on the effects of acupuncture or acupressure for smoking cessation, but there's no definitive evidence that it works. - Herbs and supplements. A few studies have been conducted on the dietary supplements SAMe, silver acetate and St. John's wort for the treatment of tobacco dependence, but there is no current evidence that any natural product improves smoking cessation rates. - Hypnosis. Although no evidence supports the use of hypnosis - also called hypnotherapy - in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful. If you choose to pursue hypnosis, talk to your doctor about finding a reputable therapist. - Meditation. Although no evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful to reduce symptoms of anxiety.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed. - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong. Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks. Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can: - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression - Increase activity in the intestines - Create more saliva and phlegm - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include: - Intense craving for nicotine - Anxiety - Depression - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping - Bad dreams and nightmares - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated - Headaches - Increased appetite and weight gain - Problems concentrating You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke. It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking. There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone. To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences. Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking. A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of: - Gum - Inhalers - Throat lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patches You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms. Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong. Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

Lungs and airways  \n\u2022 Smoke burns and inflames the lining of the airways, causing chronic cough, phlegm, wheezing and shortness of breath.  \n\u2022 Long-term injury leads to chronic bronchitis and emphysema (together called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD).  \n\u2022 It is the No. 1 cause of lung cancer; 80\u201390 % of all lung\u2010cancer deaths are linked to cigarettes.  \n\u2022 Asthma attacks become more frequent and severe.\n\n2. Heart and blood vessels  \n\u2022 Nicotine speeds the heartbeat, raises blood pressure and narrows blood vessels.  \n\u2022 Carbon monoxide reduces the blood\u2019s oxygen-carrying capacity.  \n\u2022 These changes promote atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (poor circulation in the legs and feet).  \n\u2022 Smokers are 2\u20134 x more likely to develop coronary heart disease than non-smokers.\n\n3. Brain and nervous system  \n\u2022 Nicotine reaches the brain in seconds, releasing dopamine and creating dependence/addiction.  \n\u2022 Over time it can worsen anxiety, depression and mood swings.  \n\u2022 Smoking roughly doubles the risk of stroke; some strokes can cause permanent paralysis or speech loss.\n\n4. Mouth, throat and teeth  \n\u2022 Causes cancers of the lips, tongue, mouth, throat, voice box and esophagus.  \n\u2022 Leads to gum (periodontal) disease, tooth discoloration, tooth loss and bad breath.  \n\u2022 Dulls the senses of taste and smell.\n\n5. Digestive system  \n\u2022 Increases risk of cancers of the stomach, pancreas, liver, colon and rectum.  \n\u2022 Weakens the valve between esophagus and stomach, worsening heartburn and acid reflux.  \n\u2022 Slows healing of peptic ulcers and contributes to Crohn\u2019s disease flares.\n\n6. Reproductive health and pregnancy  \n\u2022 Females: can damage the fallopian tubes and ovaries, making it harder to get pregnant; increases risk of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, pre-term delivery, placental problems and stillbirth.  \n\u2022 Males: reduces sperm count, motility and testosterone; major cause of erectile dysfunction due to damaged blood vessels.  \n\u2022 Babies born to mothers who smoke have higher rates of low birth-weight, birth defects, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and later asthma or ear infections.\n\n7. Bones, muscles and joints  \n\u2022 Tobacco chemicals interfere with bone-building cells, speeding bone loss (osteoporosis) and increasing hip, spine and wrist fractures, especially in women.  \n\u2022 Slows healing of broken bones and surgical wounds; raises risk of rotator-cuff tears and back pain.\n\n8. Immune system  \n\u2022 Smoke weakens immune defenses, so colds, flu, pneumonia and other infections occur more often and last longer.  \n\u2022 Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis are more common or more severe in smokers.\n\n9. Skin, hair and eyes  \n\u2022 Narrows skin blood vessels, reducing nutrients and oxygen \u2192 premature wrinkles, uneven skin tone, and slower wound healing.  \n\u2022 Smoking triples the risk of age-related macular degeneration and doubles the risk of cataracts, the leading causes of vision loss.  \n\u2022 Causes yellowed nails and fingers, and may speed hair loss.\n\n10. Endocrine and metabolic effects  \n\u2022 Increases insulin resistance and is a strong, independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes.  \n\u2022 Alters thyroid and adrenal hormone levels, contributing to weight redistribution (more abdominal fat).\n\n11. Cancer almost everywhere  \n\u2022 Besides lung, mouth and digestive cancers, smoking is linked to cancers of the kidney, bladder, cervix, ovary, nasopharynx, and certain leukemias.  \n\u2022 At least 70 of the 7,000+ chemicals in tobacco smoke are known cancer-causing agents.\n\n12. Secondhand and third-hand smoke  \n\u2022 People near the smoker inhale the same toxins and suffer many of the same risks\u2014particularly children, whose lungs and immune systems are still developing.  \n\u2022 Smoke residue that settles on clothes, furniture and car interiors (\u201cthird-hand\u201d smoke) can also be ingested or inhaled, especially by infants and toddlers.\n\nGood news: what happens after quitting  \n\u2022 20 minutes: heart rate and blood pressure start to drop.  \n\u2022 12 hours: carbon-monoxide level in the blood returns to normal.  \n\u2022 2\u201312 weeks: circulation and lung function improve; exercise is easier.  \n\u2022 1 year: excess risk of heart disease is half that of a continuing smoker.  \n\u2022 5\u201310 years: risk of stroke falls to that of a non-smoker.  \n\u2022 10\u201315 years: risk of lung cancer can drop by up to 50 %; risk of heart disease returns close to that of someone who never smoked.\n\nKey takeaway  \nBecause every puff carries toxic chemicals",

But quitting can be hard. Most people who have quit smoking have tried at least once, without success, in the past. View any past attempts to quit as a learning experience, not a failure. There are many reasons to quit using tobacco. Long-term use of tobacco can increase your risk of many serious health problems. THE BENEFITS OF QUITTING You may enjoy the following when you quit smoking. - Your breath, clothes, and hair will smell better. - Your sense of smell will return. Food will taste better. - Your fingers and fingernails will slowly appear less yellow. - Your stained teeth may slowly become whiter. - Your children will be healthier and will be less likely to start smoking. - It will be easier and cheaper to find an apartment or hotel room. - You may have an easier time getting a job. - Friends may be more willing to be in your car or home. - It may be easier to find a date. Many people do not smoke and do not like to be around people who smoke. - You will save money. If you smoke a pack a day, you spend about $2,000 a year on cigarettes. HEALTH BENEFITS Some health benefits begin almost immediately. Every week, month, and year without tobacco further improves your health. - Within 20 minutes of quitting: Your blood pressure and pulse rate drop to normal and the temperature of your hands and feet increases to normal. - Within 8 hours of quitting: Your blood carbon monoxide levels drop and your blood oxygen levels increase to normal levels. - Within 24 hours of quitting: Your risk of a sudden heart attack goes down. - Within 48 hours of quitting: Your nerve endings begin to regrow. Your senses of smell and taste begin to return to normal. - Within 2 weeks to 3 months of quitting: Your circulation improves. Walking becomes easier. Your lungs work better. Wounds heal more quickly. - Within 1 to 9 months of quitting: You have more energy. Smoking-related symptoms, such as coughing, nasal congestion, fatigue, and shortness of breath improve. You will have fewer illnesses, colds, and asthma attacks. You will gradually no longer be short of breath with everyday activities. - Within 1 year of quitting: Your risk of coronary heart disease is half that of someone still using tobacco. - Within 5 years of quitting: Your risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder cancers are reduced by half. - Within 10 years of quitting: Your risk of dying from lung cancer is about one half that of a person who still smokes. Other health benefits of quitting smoking include: - Lower chance of blood clots in the legs, which may travel to the lungs - Lower risk of erectile dysfunction - Fewer problems during pregnancy, such as babies born at low birth weight, premature labor, miscarriage, and cleft lip - Lower risk of infertility due to damaged sperm - Healthier teeth, gums, and skin Infants and children who you live with will have: - Asthma that is easier to control - Fewer visits to the emergency room - Fewer colds, ear infections, and pneumonia - Reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) MAKING THE DECISION Like any addiction, quitting tobacco is difficult, especially if you do it alone. There are a lot of ways to quit smoking and many resources to help you. Talk to your health care provider about nicotine replacement therapy and smoking cessation medications. If you join smoking cessation programs, you have a much better chance of success. Such programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it. Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to: - Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events. - Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control. - Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur. - Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.

Manage stress and get good sleep  \n   \u2022 Chronic stress, depression, and short sleep (< 6 hours) raise inflammatory chemicals linked to atherosclerosis. Techniques: mindfulness, yoga, breathing exercises, counseling, setting a regular sleep schedule.\n\n7. Stay up-to-date with medical care  \n   \u2022 Lipid panel, blood pressure, and glucose checks at least every 3\u20135 years starting at age 20, or more often if you have risk factors.  \n   \u2022 Discuss statins, ezetimibe, or other cholesterol-lowering drugs if lifestyle isn\u2019t enough.  \n   \u2022 Ask whether low-dose aspirin is appropriate; it\u2019s no longer recommended for everyone, only for specific higher-risk groups.  \n   \u2022 Manage co-existing conditions (diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders).\n\n8. Special considerations  \n   \u2022 Women: Pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes) signal higher lifetime risk\u2014start prevention early.  \n   \u2022 Family history: If a parent or sibling had early heart disease (< 55 \u2642, < 65 \u2640), talk to your clinician about earlier screening and possibly calcium scoring.  \n   \u2022 Air quality: Avoid secondhand smoke and heavy air pollution when possible; both irritate blood vessels.\n\nBottom line  \nAtherosclerosis usually develops silently for decades. The combination of a heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, tobacco avoidance, weight control, stress management, and evidence-based medical care can delay, halt, or even partially reverse plaque buildup.

Quit tobacco in all forms  \n   \u2022 Smoking is one of the strongest accelerators of plaque buildup. Quitting drops heart-attack risk by ~50 % within a year. Seek help if needed\u2014counseling, nicotine replacement, or medications double success rates.\n\n6. Manage stress and get good sleep  \n   \u2022 Chronic stress, depression, and short sleep (< 6 hours) raise inflammatory chemicals linked to atherosclerosis. Techniques: mindfulness, yoga, breathing exercises, counseling, setting a regular sleep schedule.\n\n7. Stay up-to-date with medical care  \n   \u2022 Lipid panel, blood pressure, and glucose checks at least every 3\u20135 years starting at age 20, or more often if you have risk factors.  \n   \u2022 Discuss statins, ezetimibe, or other cholesterol-lowering drugs if lifestyle isn\u2019t enough.  \n   \u2022 Ask whether low-dose aspirin is appropriate; it\u2019s no longer recommended for everyone, only for specific higher-risk groups.  \n   \u2022 Manage co-existing conditions (diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders).\n\n8. Special considerations  \n   \u2022 Women: Pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes) signal higher lifetime risk\u2014start prevention early.  \n   \u2022 Family history: If a parent or sibling had early heart disease (< 55 \u2642, < 65 \u2640), talk to your clinician about earlier screening and possibly calcium scoring.  \n   \u2022 Air quality: Avoid secondhand smoke and heavy air pollution when possible; both irritate blood vessels.\n\nBottom line  \nAtherosclerosis usually develops silently for decades. The combination of a heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, tobacco avoidance, weight control, stress management, and evidence-based medical care can delay, halt, or even partially reverse plaque buildup. Partner with your healthcare team to personalize targets and monitor progress, and remember that every positive change\u2014no matter how small\u2014moves your arteries in the right direction.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nAtherosclerosis (PREVENTION): Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay atherosclerosis and its related diseases. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors you\u00a0have. One step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which can include: Heart-Healthy Eating. Adopt heart-healthy eating habits, which include eating different fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas), whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A heart-healthy diet is low in sodium, added sugar, solid fats, and refined grains. Following a heart-healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Physical Activity. Be as physically active as you can. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. Ask your doctor what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. Read more about Physical Activity and Your Heart. Quit Smoking. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Read more about Smoking and Your Heart. Weight Control. If you\u2019re overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control risk factors for\u00a0atherosclerosis. Other steps that can prevent or delay atherosclerosis include knowing your family history of atherosclerosis. If you or someone in your family has an atherosclerosis-related disease, be sure to tell your doctor. If lifestyle changes aren\u2019t enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your atherosclerosis risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises. \u00a0\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "How to Help Prevent Diabetes (Especially Type 2)\n\nImportant note \u2013 Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition and, at present, cannot be prevented. Most prevention advice focuses on type 2 diabetes, which accounts for about 90 % of all cases. The good news: many people can delay or avoid type 2 diabetes with everyday lifestyle choices.\n\n1. Know Your Risk\n\u2022 Family history of diabetes  \n\u2022 Age \u2265 45 years  \n\u2022 Overweight or obesity (BMI \u2265 25, or \u2265 23 for many Asian populations)  \n\u2022 Sedentary lifestyle  \n\u2022 History of gestational diabetes or delivering a baby > 9 lb  \n\u2022 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  \n\u2022 High blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, or cardiovascular disease  \n\u2022 Certain ethnic backgrounds (e.g., African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, Asian-American, Pacific Islander)\n\nAsk your clinician for a fasting glucose or A1C test if you have risk factors or every 3 years after age 45.\n\n2. Stay (or Reach) a Healthy Weight\nLosing just 5\u201310 % of starting weight can cut diabetes risk by roughly half in people with pre-diabetes. A slow loss of 1\u20132 lb (0.5\u20131 kg) per week is considered safe and sustainable.\n\n3. Eat for Blood-Sugar Control\n\u2022 Emphasize vegetables, fruits, beans/legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole-grain products.  \n\u2022 Choose carbohydrate sources high in fiber (\u2265 3 g per serving). Fiber slows glucose absorption.  \n\u2022 Replace sugary drinks (soda, sweet tea, juices) with water, sparkling water, or unsweetened beverages.  \n\u2022 Prefer lean protein: fish, skinless poultry, tofu, lentils, eggs, low-fat dairy.  \n\u2022 Use healthy fats: olive, canola, or other vegetable oils; avocado; nuts.  \n\u2022 Limit: refined grains (white bread, white rice), pastries, candy, processed or red meats, fried foods, trans fats, and high-sodium packaged meals.  \n\u2022 \u201cPlate method\u201d: fill \u00bd plate with non-starchy veggies, \u00bc with lean protein, \u00bc with high-fiber starch or whole grain, plus fruit or dairy on the side.\n\n4. Move Your Body Regularly\n\u2022 Aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing).  \n\u2022 Add resistance/strength training 2\u20133 times a week to build muscle, which improves insulin sensitivity.  \n\u2022 Break up long sitting periods\u2014stand or walk a few minutes every half hour.  \n\u2022 If new to exercise, start small (10 minutes a day) and build up.\n\n5. Sleep Well\n\u2022 Adults generally need 7\u20139 hours per night.  \n\u2022 Poor sleep or sleep apnea can worsen insulin resistance; ask about testing if you snore loudly or feel very tired despite sleep.\n\n6. Don\u2019t Smoke & Limit Alcohol\n\u2022 Smoking raises diabetes risk by 30\u201340 %. Get help quitting.  \n\u2022 If you drink, keep it moderate: women \u2264 1 drink/day, men \u2264 2 drinks/day.\n\n7. Manage Stress\nChronic stress hormones counteract insulin. Techniques: brisk walking, yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, counseling, adequate leisure time.\n\n8. Keep Up with Regular Checkups\n\u2022 Blood pressure, cholesterol, and A1C or fasting glucose checks.  \n\u2022 Vaccinations, eye and foot exams, and dental care support overall health.  \n\u2022 If you already have pre-diabetes, ask about formal Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP) or medication such as metformin when lifestyle change alone is not enough.\n\n9. Pregnancy Considerations\n\u2022 Before pregnancy, aim for a healthy weight and active lifestyle.  \n\u2022 During pregnancy follow prenatal screening for gestational diabetes (usually 24\u201328 weeks). Early action protects both mother and baby.\n\n10. Kids & Teens\n\u2022 Encourage at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily.  \n\u2022 Limit screen time, offer balanced meals, and avoid sugary drinks.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\u2022 You have risk factors and have never been tested.  \n\u2022 You notice symptoms \u2013 excessive thirst, frequent urination, unexplained fatigue, blurred vision, or sudden weight change.  \n\u2022 You have pre-diabetes and need structured support.\n\nBottom line\nMost cases of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, choosing nutrient-dense foods, staying physically active, getting adequate sleep, and working with your healthcare team for early screening and, if needed, medications or a structured diabetes-prevention program.\n\nThis information is for general education and does not replace individual medical advice.

        "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nhow to prevent diabetes\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHow to Help Prevent Diabetes (Especially Type 2)\n\nImportant note \u2013 Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition and, at present, cannot be prevented. Most prevention advice focuses on type 2 diabetes, which accounts for about 90 % of all cases. The good news: many people can delay or avoid type 2 diabetes with everyday lifestyle choices.\n\n1. Know Your Risk\n\u2022 Family history of diabetes  \n\u2022 Age \u2265 45 years  \n\u2022 Overweight or obesity (BMI \u2265 25, or \u2265 23 for many Asian populations)  \n\u2022 Sedentary lifestyle  \n\u2022 History of gestational diabetes or delivering a baby > 9 lb  \n\u2022 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  \n\u2022 High blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, or cardiovascular disease  \n\u2022 Certain ethnic backgrounds (e.g., African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, Asian-American, Pacific Islander)\n\nAsk your clinician for a fasting glucose or A1C test if you have risk factors or every 3 years after age 45.\n\n2. Stay (or Reach) a Healthy Weight\nLosing just 5\u201310 % of starting weight can cut diabetes risk by roughly half in people with pre-diabetes. A slow loss of 1\u20132 lb (0.5\u20131 kg) per week is considered safe and sustainable.\n\n3. Eat for Blood-Sugar Control\n\u2022 Emphasize vegetables, fruits, beans/legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole-grain products.  \n\u2022 Choose carbohydrate sources high in fiber (\u2265 3 g per serving). Fiber slows glucose absorption.  \n\u2022 Replace sugary drinks (soda, sweet tea, juices) with water, sparkling water, or unsweetened beverages.  \n\u2022 Prefer lean protein: fish, skinless poultry, tofu, lentils, eggs, low-fat dairy.  \n\u2022 Use healthy fats: olive, canola, or other vegetable oils; avocado; nuts.  \n\u2022 Limit: refined grains (white bread, white rice), pastries, candy, processed or red meats, fried foods, trans fats, and high-sodium packaged meals.  \n\u2022 \u201cPlate method\u201d: fill \u00bd plate with non-starchy veggies, \u00bc with lean protein, \u00bc with high-fiber starch or whole grain, plus fruit or dairy on the side.\n\n4. Move Your Body Regularly\n\u2022 Aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing).  \n\u2022 Add resistance/strength training 2\u20133 times a week to build muscle, which improves insulin sensitivity.  \n\u2022 Break up long sitting periods\u2014stand or walk a few minutes every half hour.  \n\u2022 If new to exercise, start small (10 minutes a day) and build up.\n\n5. Sleep Well\n\u2022 Adults generally need 7\u20139 hours per night.  \n\u2022 Poor sleep or sleep apnea can worsen insulin resistance; ask about testing if you snore loudly or feel very tired despite sleep.\n\n6. Don\u2019t Smoke & Limit Alcohol\n\u2022 Smoking raises diabetes risk by 30\u201340 %. Get help quitting.  \n\u2022 If you drink, keep it moderate: women \u2264 1 drink/day, men \u2264 2 drinks/day.\n\n7. Manage Stress\nChronic stress hormones counteract insulin. Techniques: brisk walking, yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, counseling, adequate leisure time.\n\n8. Keep Up with Regular Checkups\n\u2022 Blood pressure, cholesterol, and A1C or fasting glucose checks.  \n\u2022 Vaccinations, eye and foot exams, and dental care support overall health.  \n\u2022 If you already have pre-diabetes, ask about formal Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP) or medication such as metformin when lifestyle change alone is not enough.\n\n9. Pregnancy Considerations\n\u2022 Before pregnancy, aim for a healthy weight and active lifestyle.  \n\u2022 During pregnancy follow prenatal screening for gestational diabetes (usually 24\u201328 weeks). Early action protects both mother and baby.\n\n10. Kids & Teens\n\u2022 Encourage at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily.  \n\u2022 Limit screen time, offer balanced meals, and avoid sugary drinks.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\u2022 You have risk factors and have never been tested.  \n\u2022 You notice symptoms \u2013 excessive thirst, frequent urination, unexplained fatigue, blurred vision, or sudden weight change.  \n\u2022 You have pre-diabetes and need structured support.\n\nBottom line\nMost cases of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, choosing nutrient-dense foods, staying physically active, getting adequate sleep, and working with your healthcare team for early screening and, if needed, medications or a structured diabetes-prevention program.\n\nThis information is for general education and does not replace individual medical advice. If you have specific concerns, please consult your healthcare provider.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nDiabetes (Prevention): Keeping an ideal body weight and an active lifestyle may prevent or delay the start of type 2 diabetes. If you're overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of your body weight even helps. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes. At this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But there is promising research that shows type 1 diabetes may be delayed in some high risk people.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

What research does show, however, is that certain actions\u2014especially when started early\u2014may lower a person\u2019s risk or lessen the severity of the disorder if it does emerge.\n\n1. Before Birth and Early Childhood  \n\u2022  Obtain good prenatal care.  A healthy pregnancy that includes regular obstetric visits, vaccination as advised, avoidance of smoking, alcohol, and street drugs, and good control of medical problems (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure) reduces several brain-development risks linked to schizophrenia.  \n\u2022  Prevent and treat infections.  Maternal infections such as influenza, rubella, toxoplasmosis and certain nutritional deficiencies have been associated with increased risk for the child. Vaccination, hand-washing, and prompt medical care make a difference.  \n\u2022  Ensure adequate folic acid and other nutrients during pregnancy; breast-feed when possible; and provide children with a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish or other sources of omega-3 fatty acids, iron, vitamin D, and B-vitamins.  \n\u2022  Minimize early brain injury.

Ongoing medication, cardiac rehab, and lifestyle changes are essential to prevent another heart attack.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHeart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home.

There are more than 80 types of autoimmune disorders. The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances. When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues. The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder may result in: - The destruction of body tissue - Abnormal growth of an organ - Changes in organ function An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include: - Blood vessels - Connective tissues - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas - Joints - Muscles - Red blood cells - Skin A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include: - Addison disease - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) - Dermatomyositis - Graves disease - Hashimoto thyroiditis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Pernicious anemia - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sj\u00f6gren syndrome - Systemic lupus erythematosus - Type I diabetes Symptoms will vary based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include: - Fatigue - Fever - General ill-feeling (malaise) - Joint pain - Rash The health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease. Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include: - Antinuclear antibody tests - Autoantibody tests - CBC - Comprehensive metabolic panel - C-reactive protein (CRP) - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) - Urinalysis The goals of treatment are to: - Reduce symptoms - Control the autoimmune process - Maintain the body's ability to fight disease Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include: - Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease - Blood transfusions if blood is affected - Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are often called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TFN) blockers can be used for some diseases. The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic, but many can be controlled with treatment. Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk of infections. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders. Updated by: Laura J.

The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach. It makes and releases enzymes into the intestines that help the body digest and absorb food, especially fats. The pancreas also makes and releases insulin and glucagon. These are hormones that help the body control blood sugar levels. There are different types of pancreatic cancers. The type depends on the cell the cancer develops in. Examples include: - Adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer - Other more rare types include glucagonoma, insulinoma, islet cell tumor, VIPoma The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. It is more common in persons who: - Are obese - Have a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables - Have diabetes - Have long-term exposure to certain chemicals - Have long-term inflammation of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) - Smoke Pancreatic cancer is slightly more common in women than in men. The risk increases with age. Family history of the disease also slightly increases the chance of developing this cancer. A tumor (cancer) in the pancreas may grow without any symptoms at first. This means the cancer is often advanced when it is first found. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: - Diarrhea - Dark urine and clay-colored stools - Fatigue and weakness - Sudden increase in blood sugar level (diabetes) - Jaundice (a yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes) and itching of the skin - Loss of appetite and weight loss - Nausea and vomiting - Pain or discomfort in the upper part of the belly or abdomen The doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. During the exam, the doctor may feel a lump (mass) in your abdomen. Blood tests that may be ordered include: - Complete blood count (CBC) - Liver function tests - Serum bilirubin Imaging tests that may be ordered include: - CT scan of the abdomen - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - Endoscopic ultrasound - MRI of the abdomen Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (and what type) is made by a pancreatic biopsy. If tests confirm you have pancreatic cancer, more tests will be done to see how far the cancer has spread within and outside the pancreas. This is called staging. Staging helps guide treatment and gives you an idea of what to expect. Treatment for adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor. Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach. When the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended. When the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used. With advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the tube that carries bile is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage. This can help relieve loss of appetite, jaundice, and itching of the skin. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Some people with pancreatic cancer that can be surgically removed are cured. But in most people, the tumor has spread and cannot be completely removed at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy and radiation are often given after surgery to increase the cure rate (this is called adjuvant therapy). For pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed completely with surgery or cancer that has spread beyond the pancreas, a cure is not possible. In this case, chemotherapy is given to improve and extend one's life. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have: - Abdominal pain that does not go away - Back pain - Loss of appetite - Unexplained fatigue or weight loss - Other symptoms of this disorder Preventive measures include: - If you smoke, now is the time to quit. - Keep a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. - Exercise regularly to stay at a healthy weight.

The person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating. Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include: - Forcing oneself to vomit - Excessive exercise - Using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills) Purging often brings a sense of relief. People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder. Symptoms that other people can see include: - Spending a lot of time exercising - Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away - Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals - Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (drugs that cause vomiting), or diuretics\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "Treatments for Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) are aimed at reducing symptoms, helping boys reach typical milestones, and supporting men\u2019s long-term health.  No single plan works for everyone, so care is usually provided by a team that can include an endocrinologist, urologist/fertility specialist, primary-care clinician, psychologist, speech/occupational therapist, and sometimes a breast or orthopedic surgeon.  Commonly used options are listed below.\n\n1.  Testosterone (T) replacement  \n   \u2022  Goal: supply the hormone that the testes make in lower-than-normal amounts, starting when levels normally rise in puberty.  \n   \u2022  Benefits: deeper voice, facial/body hair, increased muscle mass, improved energy and mood, stronger bones, enlargement of penis/testes to more typical size, prevention of anemia, and possible improvement in school performance/behavior.  \n   \u2022  When started: usually around 11\u201314 years; adults who never received T can start at any age if no contraindication.  \n   \u2022  Forms: intramuscular injections every 1\u201312 weeks, skin gel/lotion applied daily, transdermal patch, or longer-acting implantation pellets.  \n   \u2022  Monitoring: blood counts, liver function, cholesterol, PSA (in older men), bone density.\n\n2.  Speech, language, occupational and physical therapy  \n   \u2022  Boys with KS often have delays in speech, coordination, or fine-motor skills. Early intervention (ideally before age 3) improves classroom performance and self-confidence.  \n   \u2022  Physical therapy helps core strength and coordination, reducing the \u201cclumsiness\u201d some boys feel.\n\n3.  Educational support  \n   \u2022  Many boys have subtle learning disabilities (reading comprehension, executive function). Individualized education plans (IEPs), tutoring, or extra time on tests can make a big difference.\n\n4.  Psychological counseling & social-skills training  \n   \u2022  Addresses shyness, anxiety, attention-deficit issues, and self-esteem.  \n   \u2022  Support groups can help adolescents and adults feel less isolated.\n\n5.  Fertility treatment / preservation  \n   \u2022  Most men with Klinefelter\u2019s make little or no sperm, but about half have small numbers present in tiny pockets of the testes.  \n   \u2022  Testicular sperm extraction or micro-TESE combined with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can allow some couples to have biologic children. Success rates vary by center (roughly 30\u201350 % when sperm are found).  \n   \u2022  Experimental options in early adolescence (cryopreservation of testicular tissue or sperm if present) are being studied.  \n   \u2022  Counseling about donor sperm, adoption, or child-free living is also part of comprehensive care.\n\n6.  Treatment of enlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia)  \n   \u2022  About two-thirds of adolescent boys/adult men have visible breast growth.  \n   \u2022  Mild cases may improve on testosterone therapy and weight control.  \n   \u2022  Persistent or cosmetically bothersome cases can be corrected with liposuction or subcutaneous mastectomy performed by a plastic surgeon.\n\n7.  Bone-health measures  \n   \u2022  Low testosterone and low vitamin D may thin bones.  \n   \u2022  Weight-bearing exercise, calcium/vitamin D supplements, and\u2014if bone density is low or fractures occur\u2014bisphosphonate or other bone-strengthening medicines are used.\n\n8.  Metabolic and general health management  \n   \u2022  Men with KS have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and blood clots. Regular screening (blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipid panel) and a heart-healthy lifestyle are recommended.  \n   \u2022  Sleep apnea screening, vaccinations, and routine cancer screenings follow general population guidelines, with the addition of breast examination.\n\n9.  Other hormone options in childhood  \n   \u2022  Short courses of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or low-dose testosterone may be used in toddlers who have micropenis to promote growth before puberty.\n\nKey points to remember  \n\u2022  Early diagnosis (ideally in childhood) allows early speech and motor therapies and timely start of testosterone.  \n\u2022  Treatments address symptoms; they do not \u201ccure\u201d the extra chromosome.  \n\u2022  Regular follow-up helps tailor the plan as needs change\u2014from assistance in school to fertility counseling and management of adult health risks.\n\nAlways discuss options with a qualified healthcare professional who knows your or your child\u2019s full medical history.",

        "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nwhat are some of the treatments available to males with klinefelter's\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nTreatments for Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) are aimed at reducing symptoms, helping boys reach typical milestones, and supporting men\u2019s long-term health.  No single plan works for everyone, so care is usually provided by a team that can include an endocrinologist, urologist/fertility specialist, primary-care clinician, psychologist, speech/occupational therapist, and sometimes a breast or orthopedic surgeon.  Commonly used options are listed below.\n\n1.  Testosterone (T) replacement  \n   \u2022  Goal: supply the hormone that the testes make in lower-than-normal amounts, starting when levels normally rise in puberty.  \n   \u2022  Benefits: deeper voice, facial/body hair, increased muscle mass, improved energy and mood, stronger bones, enlargement of penis/testes to more typical size, prevention of anemia, and possible improvement in school performance/behavior.  \n   \u2022  When started: usually around 11\u201314 years; adults who never received T can start at any age if no contraindication.  \n   \u2022  Forms: intramuscular injections every 1\u201312 weeks, skin gel/lotion applied daily, transdermal patch, or longer-acting implantation pellets.  \n   \u2022  Monitoring: blood counts, liver function, cholesterol, PSA (in older men), bone density.\n\n2.  Speech, language, occupational and physical therapy  \n   \u2022  Boys with KS often have delays in speech, coordination, or fine-motor skills. Early intervention (ideally before age 3) improves classroom performance and self-confidence.  \n   \u2022  Physical therapy helps core strength and coordination, reducing the \u201cclumsiness\u201d some boys feel.\n\n3.  Educational support  \n   \u2022  Many boys have subtle learning disabilities (reading comprehension, executive function). Individualized education plans (IEPs), tutoring, or extra time on tests can make a big difference.\n\n4.  Psychological counseling & social-skills training  \n   \u2022  Addresses shyness, anxiety, attention-deficit issues, and self-esteem.  \n   \u2022  Support groups can help adolescents and adults feel less isolated.\n\n5.  Fertility treatment / preservation  \n   \u2022  Most men with Klinefelter\u2019s make little or no sperm, but about half have small numbers present in tiny pockets of the testes.  \n   \u2022  Testicular sperm extraction or micro-TESE combined with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can allow some couples to have biologic children. Success rates vary by center (roughly 30\u201350 % when sperm are found).  \n   \u2022  Experimental options in early adolescence (cryopreservation of testicular tissue or sperm if present) are being studied.  \n   \u2022  Counseling about donor sperm, adoption, or child-free living is also part of comprehensive care.\n\n6.  Treatment of enlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia)  \n   \u2022  About two-thirds of adolescent boys/adult men have visible breast growth.  \n   \u2022  Mild cases may improve on testosterone therapy and weight control.  \n   \u2022  Persistent or cosmetically bothersome cases can be corrected with liposuction or subcutaneous mastectomy performed by a plastic surgeon.\n\n7.  Bone-health measures  \n   \u2022  Low testosterone and low vitamin D may thin bones.  \n   \u2022  Weight-bearing exercise, calcium/vitamin D supplements, and\u2014if bone density is low or fractures occur\u2014bisphosphonate or other bone-strengthening medicines are used.\n\n8.  Metabolic and general health management  \n   \u2022  Men with KS have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and blood clots. Regular screening (blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipid panel) and a heart-healthy lifestyle are recommended.  \n   \u2022  Sleep apnea screening, vaccinations, and routine cancer screenings follow general population guidelines, with the addition of breast examination.\n\n9.  Other hormone options in childhood  \n   \u2022  Short courses of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or low-dose testosterone may be used in toddlers who have micropenis to promote growth before puberty.\n\nKey points to remember  \n\u2022  Early diagnosis (ideally in childhood) allows early speech and motor therapies and timely start of testosterone.  \n\u2022  Treatments address symptoms; they do not \u201ccure\u201d the extra chromosome.  \n\u2022  Regular follow-up helps tailor the plan as needs change\u2014from assistance in school to fertility counseling and management of adult health risks.\n\nAlways discuss options with a qualified healthcare professional who knows your or your child\u2019s full medical history.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nKlinefelter syndrome (Treatment): If you or your son is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, your health care team may include a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders involving the body's glands and hormones (endocrinologist), a speech therapist, a pediatrician, a physical therapist, a genetic counselor, a reproductive medicine or infertility specialist, and a counselor or psychologist. Although there's no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it's never too late to get help. Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome may include: - Testosterone replacement therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone replacement can be given to help stimulate changes that normally occur at puberty, such as developing a deeper voice, growing facial and body hair, and increasing muscle mass and penis size. Testosterone therapy can also improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It will not result in testicle enlargement or improve infertility. - Breast tissue removal. In males who develop enlarged breasts, excess breast tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, leaving a more normal-looking chest. - Speech and physical therapy. These treatments can help boys with Klinefelter syndrome overcome problems with speech, language and muscle weakness. - Educational evaluation and support. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have trouble learning and socializing and can benefit from extra assistance. Talk to your child's teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support might help. - Fertility treatment. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to father children because few or no sperm are produced in the testicles. For some men with minimal sperm production, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is removed from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg. - Psychological counseling. Having Klinefelter syndrome can be a challenge, especially during puberty and young adulthood. For men with the condition, coping with infertility can be difficult. A family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help work through the emotional issues.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Biology and genetics  \n   \u2022 Some children inherit a tendency to store fat more easily  \n   \u2022 Certain medical conditions or rare genetic syndromes (e.g., Prader-Willi)  \n   \u2022 Medications that can increase appetite or slow metabolism (steroids, some seizure or mood medicines)\n\n5. Emotional and social factors  \n   \u2022 Stress, anxiety, depression, bullying\u2014can trigger overeating or \u201ccomfort\u201d eating  \n   \u2022 Lack of sleep: tired children often crave high-calorie foods and are less active\n\n6.

Early prostate cancer usually does not cause symptoms. However, if prostate cancer develops and is not treated, it can cause these symptoms: - a need to urinate frequently, especially at night - difficulty starting urination or holding back urine - inability to urinate - weak or interrupted flow of urine - painful or burning urination - difficulty in having an erection - painful ejaculation - blood in urine or semen - pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. a need to urinate frequently, especially at night difficulty starting urination or holding back urine inability to urinate weak or interrupted flow of urine painful or burning urination difficulty in having an erection painful ejaculation blood in urine or semen pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. Any of these symptoms may be caused by cancer, but more often they are due to enlargement of the prostate, which is not cancer. If You Have Symptoms If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a urologist to find out if you need treatment. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the genitourinary system. The doctor will ask questions about your medical history and perform an exam to try to find the cause of the prostate problems. The PSA Test The doctor may also suggest a blood test to check your prostate specific antigen, or PSA, level. PSA levels can be high not only in men who have prostate cancer, but also in men with an enlarged prostate gland and men with infections of the prostate. PSA tests may be very useful for early cancer diagnosis. However, PSA tests alone do not always tell whether or not cancer is present. PSA screening for prostate cancer is not perfect. (Screening tests check for disease in a person who shows no symptoms.) Most men with mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer, and many men with prostate cancer have normal levels of PSA. A recent study revealed that men with low prostate specific antigen levels, or PSA, may still have prostate cancer. Also, the digital rectal exam can miss many prostate cancers. Other Tests The doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. But to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. During a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. If Cancer is Present If a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. Doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope. One way of grading prostate cancer, called the Gleason system, uses scores of 2 to 10. Another system uses G1 through G4. The higher the score, the higher the grade of the tumor. High-grade tumors grow more quickly and are more likely to spread than low-grade tumors.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. A tension headache: - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. - Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore. A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine: - The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. It may spread to both sides. - The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around. - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache. Other types of headaches: - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning. - Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome. - Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area. In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something more serious, such as: - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) - Blood pressure that is very high - Brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, or abscess - Brain tumor - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Lack of oxygen during sleep (sleep apnea) - Problems with the blood vessels and bleeding in the brain, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain aneurysm, or stroke\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\"\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

If blood test results are negative and your doctor still suspects celiac disease, he or she may order more blood tests.If a biopsy and other blood tests do not clearly confirm celiac disease, your doctor may order genetic blood tests to check for certain gene changes, or variants.4 You are very unlikely to have celiac disease if these gene variants are not present. Having these variants alone is not enough to diagnose celiac disease because they also are common in people without the disease. In fact, most people with these genes will never get celiac disease.If blood tests suggest you have celiac disease, your doctor will perform a biopsy to be sure. During a biopsy, the doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your small intestine during a procedure called an upper GI endoscopy.If a doctor suspects you have dermatitis herpetiformis, he or she will perform a skin biopsy. For a skin biopsy, the doctor removes tiny pieces of skin tissue to examine with a microscope.A doctor examines the skin tissue and checks the tissue for antibodies common in celiac disease. If the skin tissue has the antibodies, a doctor will perform blood tests to confirm celiac disease. If the skin biopsy and blood tests both suggest celiac disease, you may not need an intestinal biopsy.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria. - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia. - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia. - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

These infections cause inflammation in the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs. This inflammation causes the air sacs to fill with fluid and pus. Bacteria Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Many types of bacteria can cause bacterial pneumonia. Streptococcus\u00a0pneumoniae or pneumococcus bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the United States. If your pneumonia is caused by one of the following types of bacteria, it is called atypical pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila.\u00a0This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains. Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\u00a0This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However,\u00a0Mycoplasma pneumoniae\u00a0can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis. This type of bacteria is a common cause of \u201cwalking pneumonia\u201d. Chlamydia pneumoniae.\u00a0This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a viral cold or the flu. Bacterial pneumonia often affects just one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia. Read more Most of the time, the body filters bacteria out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system, the shape of your nose and throat, your ability to\u00a0cough, and fine, hair-like structures called cilia help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. Read How the Lungs Work for more information. Sometimes bacteria manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if: Your immune system is weak A germ is very strong Your body fails to filter out the bacteria from the air that you breathe. For example, if you can't cough because you've had a\u00a0stroke\u00a0or are sedated, bacteria may remain in your airways. When bacteria reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the bacteria. These cells cause inflammation in alveoli (air sacs) and can cause these spaces to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia. Viruses Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. The influenza or flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in children younger than one year old. \u00a0Other viruses can cause pneumonia such as the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about one to three weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia. Fungi Pneumocystis pneumonia is a serious fungal infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. It occurs in people who have weak immune systems due to HIV/AIDS or the long-term use of medicines that suppress their immune systems, such as those used to treat cancer or as part of organ or\u00a0blood and marrow stem cell transplant procedures. Other fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia. The following are three fungi that occur in the soil in some parts of the United States and can cause some people to get pneumonia. Coccidioidomycosis. This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest. It is the cause of valley fever. Histoplasmosis. This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. Cryptococcus. This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include: - Nausea - Vomiting - Loss of appetite - Fatigue and weakness - Sleep problems - Changes in how much you urinate - Decreased mental sharpness - Muscle twitches and cramps - Swelling of feet and ankles - Persistent itching - Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart - Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs - High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: - Type 1 or type 2 diabetes - High blood pressure - Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli) - Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures - Polycystic kidney disease - Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers - Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys - Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis) Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: - Diabetes - High blood pressure - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Smoking - Obesity - Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American - Family history of kidney disease - Abnormal kidney structure - Older age Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include: - Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) - A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures - Anemia - Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility - Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures - Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection - Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium) - Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus - Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival As a first step toward diagnosis of kidney disease, your doctor discusses your personal and family history with you. Among other things, your doctor might ask questions about whether you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, if you've taken a medication that might affect kidney function, if you've noticed changes in your urinary habits, and whether you have any family members who have kidney disease. Next, your doctor performs a physical exam, also checking for signs of problems with your heart or blood vessels, and conducts a neurological exam. For kidney disease diagnosis, you may also need certain tests and procedures, such as: - Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood. - Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases. - Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle that's inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what's causing your kidney problem. Depending on the underlying cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure. Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you may need treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Treating the cause Your doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary, depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, has been controlled. Treating complications Kidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments may include: - High blood pressure medications. People with kidney disease may experience worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend medications to lower your blood pressure - commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers - and to preserve kidney function. High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you may need frequent blood tests to monitor your condition. Your doctor will likely also recommend a water pill (diuretic) and a low-salt diet. - Medications to lower cholesterol levels. Your doctor may recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often experience high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease. - Medications to treat anemia. In certain situations, your doctor may recommend supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron. Erythropoietin supplements aid in production of more red blood cells, which may relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia. - Medications to relieve swelling. People with chronic kidney disease may retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs, as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body. - Medications to protect your bones. Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You may also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood, and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification). - A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood. As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor may recommend eating less protein. Your doctor may also ask you to meet with a dietitian who can suggest ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet. Your doctor may recommend follow-up testing at regular intervals to see whether your kidney disease remains stable or progresses. Treatment for end-stage kidney disease If your kidneys can't keep up with waste and fluid clearance on their own and you develop complete or near-complete kidney failure, you have end-stage kidney disease. At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. - Dialysis. Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood. In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube (catheter) inserted into your abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a period of time, the dialysis solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it. - Kidney transplant. A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can come from deceased or living donors. You'll need to take medications for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ. You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant. For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option is to treat kidney failure with conservative measures. However, once you have complete kidney failure, your life expectancy generally would be only a few months. Potential future treatments Regenerative medicine holds the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that today are beyond repair. Regenerative medicine approaches include: - Boosting the body's natural ability to heal itself - Using healthy cells, tissues or organs from a living or deceased donor to replace damaged ones - Delivering specific types of cells or cell products to diseased tissues or organs to restore tissue and organ function For people with chronic kidney disease, regenerative medicine approaches may be developed in the future to help slow progression of the disease. As part of your treatment for chronic kidney disease, your doctor may recommend a special diet to help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian who can analyze your current diet and suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys. Depending on your situation, kidney function and overall health, your dietitian may recommend that you: - Avoid products with added salt. Lower the amount of sodium you eat each day by avoiding products with added salt, including many convenience foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses. - Choose lower potassium foods. Your dietitian may recommend that you choose lower potassium foods at each meal. High-potassium foods include bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Examples of low-potassium foods include apples, cabbage, carrots, green beans, grapes and strawberries. Be aware that many salt substitutes contain potassium, so you generally should avoid them if you have kidney failure. - Limit the amount of protein you eat. Your dietitian will estimate the appropriate number of grams of protein you need each day and make recommendations based on that amount. High-protein foods include lean meats, eggs, milk, cheese and beans. Low-protein foods include vegetables, fruits, breads and cereals.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

People with binge eating disorder often feel out of control and eat a large amount of food at one time (called a binge). Unlike other eating disorders, people who have binge eating disorder do not throw up the food or exercise too much. Binge eating disorder is a serious health problem, but people with binge eating disorder can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder is a type of eating disorder. Eating disorders are mental health problems that cause extreme and dangerous eating behaviors. These extreme eating behaviors cause other serious health problems and sometimes death. Some eating disorders also involve extreme exercise. According to the American Psychiatric Association, women with binge eating disorder feel out of control and eat too much (binge), at least once a week for at least three months. During binges women with binge eating disorder usually eat faster than normal, eat until they are uncomfortable, eat when they are not physically hungry, and feel embarrassed, disgusted, or depressed because of the binges. Women with this type of eating disorder may be overweight or obese. Women with eating disorders, such as binge eating disorder, bulimia, and anorexia, have a mental health condition that affects how they eat, and sometimes how they exercise. These eating disorders threaten their health. Unlike people with anorexia or bulimia, people with binge eating disorder do not throw up their food, exercise a lot, or starve themselves. People with binge eating disorder are often overweight or obese. But not all people with binge eating disorder are overweight, and being overweight does not always mean you have binge eating disorder. It is possible to have more than one eating disorder in your lifetime. Regardless of what type of eating disorder you may have, you can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder affects more than 3% of women in the United States. More than half of people with binge eating disorder are women.1 Binge eating disorder affects women of all races and ethnicities. It is the most common eating disorder among Hispanic, Asian-American, and African-American women.2,3,4 Some women may be more at risk for binge eating disorder. It can be difficult to tell whether someone has binge eating disorder. Many women with binge eating disorder hide their behavior because they are embarrassed. You may have binge eating disorder if, for at least once a week over the past three months, you have binged. Binge eating disorder means you have at least three of these symptoms while binging:8 People with binge eating disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. Researchers are not sure exactly what causes binge eating disorder and other eating disorders. Researchers think that eating disorders might happen because of a combination of a person's biology and life events. This combination includes having specific genes, a person's biology, body image and self-esteem, social experiences, family health history, and sometimes other mental health illnesses. Studies suggest that people with binge eating disorder may use overeating as a way to deal with anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety, or stress.9,10 Researchers are studying how changing levels of brain chemicals may affect eating habits. Neuroimaging, or pictures of the brain, may lead to a better understanding of binge eating disorder.11 Learn more about current research on binge eating disorder. Many, but not all, women with binge eating disorder are overweight or obese. Obesity raises your risk for many serious health problems:12 People with binge eating disorder often have other serious mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. These problems can seriously affect a woman's everyday life and can be treated. Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. It may be difficult to talk to a doctor or nurse about secret eating behaviors. But doctors and nurses want to help you be healthy. Being honest about your eating behaviors with a doctor or nurse is a good way to ask for help. Your doctor may also do blood, urine, or other tests for other health problems, such as heart problems or gallbladder disease, that can be caused by binge eating disorder. Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better. Treatment plans may include one or more of the following: Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat in healthy ways again.14 Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again. Binge eating disorder can cause problems getting pregnant and during pregnancy. Pregnancy can also trigger binge eating disorder. Obesity raises the level of the hormone estrogen in your body. Higher levels of estrogen can stop you from ovulating, or releasing an egg from the ovary. This can make it more difficult to get pregnant. However, if you do not want to have children right now and have sex, you should use birth control. Overweight or obesity may also cause problems during pregnancy. Overweight and obesity raises your risk for: Pregnancy can raise the risk for binge eating disorder in women who are at higher risk for eating disorders. In one study, almost half of the women with binge eating disorder got the condition during pregnancy. The research suggests that binge eating during pregnancy may be caused by:16 After pregnancy, postpartum depression and weight from pregnancy can trigger binge eating disorder in women with a history of binge eating. Women with binge eating disorder before pregnancy often gain more weight during pregnancy than women without an eating disorder. Researchers think that weight gain during pregnancy may cause some women who had binge eating disorder before pregnancy to binge eat during pregnancy.17 Yes. Women who have recovered from binge eating disorder, are at a healthy weight, and have normal menstrual cycles have a better chance of getting pregnant and having a safe and healthy pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you had an eating disorder in the past and are trying to become pregnant. Maybe. Some medicines used to treat binge eating disorder can pass through breastmilk. Certain antidepressants can be used safely during breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor to find out what medicine works best for you. Learn more about medicines and breastfeeding in our Breastfeeding. You can also enter a medicine into the LactMed database to find out if the medicine passes through breastmilk and about any possible side effects for your nursing baby.

COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause\u00a0coughing\u00a0that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants\u2014such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts\u2014also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand\u00a0how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions\u2014emphysema\u00a0and chronic\u00a0bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity\u2014from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development\u2014can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

However, doctors often don't know why congenital heart defects occur. Heredity may play a role in some heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child with the defect. Rarely, more than one child in a family is born with a heart defect. Children who have genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, often have congenital heart defects. In fact, half of all babies who have Down syndrome have congenital heart defects. Smoking during pregnancy also has been linked to several congenital heart defects, including septal defects.

Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jaw bone (maxillary hypoplasia), a broad nose, protruding nostrils (nares), an abnormally prominent brow, down-slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large low-set ears, and unusually thick eyebrows. Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), unusual prominence of the breastbone (pigeon chest, or pectus carinatum), dental abnormalities, and short, hyperextensible, tapered fingers. Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males. The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1). Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two. It is unclear how changes (mutations) in the DNA structure of the gene lead to the clinical findings.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Some forms of lymphoma are very slow growing. You and your doctor may decide to wait to treat your lymphoma when it causes signs and symptoms that interfere with your daily activities. Until then, you may undergo periodic tests to monitor your condition. - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. The drugs are usually administered through a vein, but can also be taken as a pill, depending on the specific drugs you receive. - Other drug therapy. Other drugs used to treat lymphoma include targeted drugs that focus on specific abnormalities in your cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. - Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, involves using high doses of chemotherapy and radiation to suppress your bone marrow. Then healthy bone marrow stem cells from your body or from a donor are infused into your blood where they travel to your bones and rebuild your bone marrow.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.) People who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath. Bronchitis Overview The two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing). Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed). Sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone. Several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis. Most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care. Chronic Bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. Viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual. Chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis. Acute bronchitis Chronic bronchitis Industrial bronchitis Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Sometimes bacteria can cause the condition. Certain substances can irritate your lungs and airways and raise your risk for acute bronchitis. For example, inhaling or being exposed to tobacco smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution raises your risk for the condition. These lung irritants also can make symptoms worse. Being exposed to a high level of dust or fumes, such as from an explosion or a big fire, also may lead to acute bronchitis. Chronic Bronchitis Repeatedly breathing in fumes that irritate and damage lung and airway tissues causes chronic bronchitis. Smoking is the major cause of the condition. Breathing in air pollution and dust or fumes from the environment or workplace also can lead to chronic bronchitis. People who have chronic bronchitis go through periods when symptoms become much worse than usual. During these times, they also may have acute viral or bacterial bronchitis. Bronchitis is a very common condition. Millions of cases occur every year. Elderly people, infants, and young children are at higher risk for acute bronchitis than people in other age groups. People of all ages can develop chronic bronchitis, but it occurs more often in people who are older than 45. Also, many adults who develop chronic bronchitis are smokers. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. Smoking and having an existing lung disease greatly increase your risk for bronchitis. Contact with dust, chemical fumes, and vapors from certain jobs also increases your risk for the condition. Examples include jobs in coal mining, textile manufacturing, grain handling, and livestock farming. Air pollution, infections, and allergies can worsen the symptoms of chronic bronchitis, especially if you smoke. Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis caused by an infection usually develops after you already have a cold or the flu. Symptoms of a cold or the flu include sore throat, fatigue (tiredness), fever, body aches, stuffy or runny nose, vomiting, and diarrhea. The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a persistent cough, which may last 10 to 20 days. The cough may produce clear mucus (a slimy substance). If the mucus is yellow or green, you may have a bacterial infection as well. Even after the infection clears up, you may still have a dry cough for days or weeks. Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), low fever, and chest tightness or pain. If your acute bronchitis is severe, you also may have shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Chronic Bronchitis The signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis include coughing, wheezing, and chest discomfort. The coughing may produce large amounts of mucus. This type of cough often is called a smoker's cough. Your doctor usually will diagnose bronchitis based on your signs and symptoms. He or she may ask questions about your cough, such as how long you've had it, what you're coughing up, and how much you cough. Your doctor also will likely ask: About your medical history Whether you've recently had a cold or the flu Whether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke Whether you've been exposed to dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds in your lungs. He or she also may: Look at your mucus to see whether you have a bacterial infection Test the oxygen levels in your blood using a sensor attached to your fingertip or toe Recommend a chest x ray, lung function tests, or blood tests The main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier. If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. Antibiotics usually aren't prescribed for acute bronchitis. This is because they don't work against viruses\u2014the most common cause of acute bronchitis. However, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. A humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. If your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. You take this medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists). If you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. These medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form). If you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. This treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen. One of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. If you smoke, it's very important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants, such as dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. You can't always prevent acute or chronic bronchitis. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for both conditions. The most important step is to quit smoking or not start smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For example, wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you use paint, paint remover, varnish, or other substances with strong fumes. This will help protect your lungs. Wash your hands often to limit your exposure to germs and bacteria. Your doctor also may advise you to get a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition. Lifestyle Changes The most important step is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. This will help keep your lungs healthy. Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Here are things to try: - Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching. - Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area. - Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath. - Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin. - Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity. - Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness. - Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas. Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash. - Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early. - Antiviral medicine may be very important forthose who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids. - Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. Do NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reyes syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used. A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Calcium carbonate overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of a product containing this substance. This can be by accident or on purpose. This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Calcium carbonate can be dangerous in large amounts. Some products that contain calcium carbonate are certain: - Antacids (Tums, Chooz) - Mineral supplements - Hand lotions - Vitamin and mineral supplements Other products may also contain calcium carbonate. Symptoms of a calcium carbonate overdose include: - Abdominal pain - Bone pain - Coma - Confusion - Constipation - Depression - Diarrhea - Headache - Irregular heartbeat - Muscle twitching - Nausea - Vomiting Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. Have this information ready: - Person's age, weight, and condition - The name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) - When it was swallowed - The amount swallowed Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood tests may be done. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: - Activated charcoal - Blood and urine tests - Breathing support - Chest x-ray - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) - Intravenous fluids (through a vein) - Laxative - Medicine to treat symptoms - Tube through the mouth into the stomach to empty the stomach (gastric lavage) Calcium carbonate is not very poisonous. Recovery is quite likely. But, long-term overuse is more serious than a single overdose, because it can cause kidney damage. Few people die from an antacid overdose.

The virus does not discriminate by race, sex or normal state of health.\n\nWhere does the risk come from?\n\n\u2022 Geography: The Aedes mosquito is common in the tropics and subtropics\u2014most of Southeast and South-Central Asia, the Pacific Islands, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America, parts of Africa and the Middle East, and, increasingly, the southern United States. If you live in\u2014or travel to\u2014an area where dengue is circulating, you are at risk.\n\n\u2022 Environment and lifestyle: Urban or semi-urban neighborhoods with standing water (e.g., water storage containers, discarded tires, flower pots) allow Aedes mosquitoes to breed. Poor window/door screening or lack of air-conditioning increases exposure to bites.\n\nDoes age or race matter?\n\n\u2022 Age: All ages can be infected.

You can get it if an infected mosquito bites you. Dengue does not spread from person to person. It is common in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States. Symptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening. There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then, drinking lots of fluids, resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids. To lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is found - Wear insect repellent with DEET - Wear clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet - Close unscreened doors and windows NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Some medications that are changed by the liver include omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and pantoprazole (Protonix); diazepam (Valium); carisoprodol (Soma); nelfinavir (Viracept); and others. Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates) Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Grapefruit juice might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications. Taking grapefruit juice along with some medications that are broken down by the liver can increase the effects and side effects of some medications. Before taking grapefruit juice talk to your healthcare provider if you take any medications that are changed by the liver. Some medications that are changed by the liver include diclofenac (Cataflam, Voltaren), ibuprofen (Motrin), meloxicam (Mobic), and piroxicam (Feldene); celecoxib (Celebrex); amitriptyline (Elavil); warfarin (Coumadin); glipizide (Glucotrol); losartan (Cozaar); and others. Methadone (Dolophine) Grapefruit juice might increase how much methadone (Dolophine) the body absorbs. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking methadone (Dolophine) might increase the effects and side effects of methadone (Dolophine). Nadolol (Corgard) Nadolol (Corgard) is moved by pumps in cells in the body. Grapefruit might change how these pumps work and decrease how much nadolol (Corgard) gets absorbed by the body. This could make this medication less effective. However, some research shows that grapefruit does not affect how much nadolol (Corgard) gets absorbed by the body. Until more is known, follow any instructions on the nadolol (Corgard) label related to intake of grapefruit. Nilotinib (Tasigna) Grapefruit juice can increase how much Nilotinib (Tasigna) the body absorbs. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking Nilotinib (Tasigna) might increase the effects and side effects. Avoid drinking grapefruit juice if you are taking Nilotinib (Tasigna). Oxycodone (Oxycontin) The body breaks down oxycodone (Oxycontin) to get rid of it. Grapefruit juice can decrease how quickly the body breaks down oxycodone (Oxycontin). Drinking grapefruit juice while taking oxycodone (Oxycontin) might increase the effects and side effects of Oxycodone (Oxycontin). Primaquine Grapefruit juice can increase how much primaquine is available in the body. It is unclear what effects this might have. Be cautious with this combination. Saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase) Drinking grapefruit juice can increase how much saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase) the body absorbs. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase) might increase the effects and side effects of saquinavir. Sertraline The body breaks down sertraline to get rid of it. Grapefruit can decrease how quickly the body breaks down sertraline. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking sertraline can increase the effects and side effects of sertraline. Sunitinib (Sutent) The body breaks down sunitinib (Sutent) to get rid of it. Grapefruit can decrease how quickly the body breaks down sunitinib (Sutent). Drinking grapefruit juice while taking sunitinib (Sutent) can increase the effects and side effects of sunitinib (Sutent). But some research shows that the effect of grapefruit on sunitinib (Sutent) is not a big concern. Until more is known, follow any instructions on the sunitinib (Sutent) label related to intake of grapefruit. Tacrolimus Drinking grapefruit juice might increase the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking tacrolimus might increase the risk for side effects. Talinolol Grapefruit juice can reduce how much talinolol is available in the body. Drinking grapefruit juice with talinolol might reduce the effects of talinolol. Theophylline Drinking grapefruit juice might decrease the effects of theophylline. There's not enough information to know if this is a big concern. Tolvaptan (Samsca) The body breaks down tolvaptan (Samsca) to get rid of it. Grapefruit can decrease how quickly the body breaks down tolvaptan (Samsca). Drinking grapefruit juice while taking tolvaptan (Samsca) can increase the effects and side effects of tolvaptan (Samsca). Warfarin (Coumadin) Warfarin (Coumadin) is used to slow blood clotting. Drinking grapefruit juice might increase the effects of warfarin (Coumadin) and increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. Be sure to have your blood checked regularly. The dose of your warfarin (Coumadin) might need to be changed. Minor Be watchful with this combination. Acebutolol (Sectral) Acebutolol (Sectral) is moved by pumps in cells in the body. Grapefruit might change how these pumps work and decrease how much acebutolol (Sectral) gets absorbed by the body. This could make this medication less effective. To avoid this interaction, separate taking this medication from consuming grapefruit by at least 4 hours. Amprenavir (Agenerase) Grapefruit might slightly decrease how much amprenavir (Agenerase) is absorbed by the body. But this interaction is probably not a major concern.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or result in relatively minor skin infections. But staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and drainage of the infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond to common antibiotics. Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). As a result, signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include: - Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil, a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks. - Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually features large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust. - Cellulitis. Cellulitis - an infection of the deeper layers of skin - causes skin redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores (ulcers) or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too. - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced as a result of a staph infection may lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition features fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off - leaving a red, raw surface that looks like a burn. Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include: - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Dehydration - Low blood pressure Also known as blood poisoning, septicemia occurs when staph bacteria enter a person's bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of septicemia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body, to produce infections affecting: - Internal organs, such as your brain, heart or lungs - Bones and muscles - Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria and has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with: - A high fever - Nausea and vomiting - A rash on your palms and soles that resembles sunburn - Confusion - Muscle aches - Diarrhea - Abdominal pain Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Signs and symptoms may include: - Joint swelling - Severe pain in the affected joint - Fever Go to the doctor if you or your child has: - An area of red, irritated or painful skin - Pus-filled blisters - Fever You may also want to consult your doctor if: - Skin infections are being passed from one family member to another - Two or more family members have skin infections at the same time Many people carry staph bacteria and never develop staph infections. However, if you develop a staph infection, there's a good chance that it's from bacteria you've been carrying around for some time. These bacteria can also be transmitted from person to person. Because staph bacteria are so hardy, they can live on inanimate objects such as pillowcases or towels long enough to transfer to the next person who touches them. Staph bacteria are able to survive: - Drying - Extremes of temperature - Stomach acid - High levels of salt A variety of factors - including the status of your immune system to the types of sports you play - can increase your risk of developing staph infections. Certain disorders or the medications used to treat them can make you more susceptible to staph infections. People who may be more likely to get a staph infection include those with: - Diabetes who use insulin - HIV/AIDS - Kidney failure requiring dialysis - Weakened immune systems - either from a disease or medications that suppress the immune system - Cancer, especially those who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation - Skin damage from conditions such as eczema, insect bites or minor trauma that opens the skin - Respiratory illness, such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema Despite vigorous attempts to eradicate them, staph bacteria remain present in hospitals, where they attack the most vulnerable, including people with: - Weakened immune systems - Burns - Surgical wounds Staph bacteria can travel along the medical tubing that connects the outside world with your internal organs. Examples include: - Dialysis tubing - Urinary catheters - Feeding tubes - Breathing tubes - Intravascular catheters Staph bacteria can spread easily through cuts, abrasions and skin-to-skin contact. Staph infections may also spread in the locker room through shared razors, towels, uniforms or equipment. Food handlers who don't properly wash their hands can transfer staph from their skin to the food they're preparing. Foods that are contaminated with staph look and taste normal. If staph bacteria invade your bloodstream, you may develop a type of infection that affects your entire body. Called sepsis, this infection can lead to septic shock - a life-threatening episode with extremely low blood pressure. To diagnose a staph infection, your doctor will: - Perform a physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will closely examine any skin lesions you may have. - Collect a sample for testing. Most often, doctors diagnose staph infections by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of the bacteria. Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you're given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months. Complications of tetanus infection may include: - Broken bones. The severity of spasms may cause the spine and other bones to break. - Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism). A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches. - Death. Severe tetanus-induced (tetanic) muscle spasms can interfere with or stop your breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Lack of oxygen may also induce cardiac arrest and death. Pneumonia is another cause of death.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",
