              "text": "Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome: Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is a rare disease passed down through families. The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through the intestines. Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by a defect in a gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). The defect makes it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins. It is an autosomal recessive condition that more often affects males. Symptoms include: - Balance and coordination difficulties - Curvature of spine - Decreased vision that gets worse over time - Developmental delay - Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy - Muscle weakness - Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10 - Protruding abdomen - Slurred speech - Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools There may be damage to the retina of the eye (retinitis pigmentosa). Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include: - Apolipoprotein B blood test - Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K) - \"Burr-cell\" malformation of the red cells (acanthocytosis) - Complete blood count (CBC) - Cholesterol studies - Electromyography - Eye exam - Nerve conduction velocity - Stool sample analysis Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the MTP gene. Treatment involves large doses of vitamin supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. People with this condition should talk to a nutritionist. Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This involves: - Limiting fat intake to 5 to 20 grams per day. - Do not eat more than 5 ounces daily (140 grams) of lean meat, fish, or poultry. - Use skim milk instead of whole milk. Supplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider. They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage. How well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. Complications may include: - Blindness - Mental deterioration - Loss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia) Call your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person. High doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.

Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling."

            "text": "I'm so sorry to hear about your friend's condition. Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. The symptoms your friend is experiencing, such as severe anemia, coughing up blood, and frequent blood transfusions, are consistent with a severe form of thalassemia, likely beta-thalassemia major.\n\n**Treatment options:**\n\nWhile there is no cure for thalassemia, various treatments can help manage the condition and improve quality of life. The current treatment for thalassemia major typically involves:\n\n1. **Regular blood transfusions**: Every 16-20 days, as your friend is currently receiving, to help increase red blood cell count and reduce anemia.\n2. **Iron chelation therapy**: To remove excess iron from the body, which can build up due to frequent blood transfusions and cause damage to organs like the heart, liver, and pancreas.\n3. **Folic acid supplements**: To help increase red blood cell production.\n\n**Advanced treatment options:**\n\nIn some cases, more advanced treatments may be considered, such as:\n\n1. **Bone marrow transplantation**: Also known as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, this procedure can potentially cure thalassemia major by replacing the patient's bone marrow with healthy stem cells.\n2. **Gene therapy**: Researchers are exploring gene therapy as a potential treatment for thalassemia, which involves introducing a healthy copy of the HBB gene (responsible for hemoglobin production) into the patient's cells.\n\n**Centers of excellence for thalassemia treatment:**\n\nThere are several renowned medical centers around the world that specialize in treating thalassemia.

Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Absence seizure: An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 6 to 12. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may occur with other types of seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: - Occur many times a day - Occur for weeks to months before being noticed - Interfere with school and learning - Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: - Stop walking and start again a few seconds later - Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: - Wide awake - Thinking clearly - Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: - Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing - Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.

They are most common in children and often involve a stare or a brief loss of awareness, lasting a few seconds. During an absence seizure, the person may stop what they are doing, stare blankly ahead, and not respond to their environment. After the seizure, they usually resume their previous activity, often unaware that anything has happened.\n\nRegarding damage from absence seizures, the impact can be both physical and mental, though the extent of this damage varies widely among individuals.\n\n**Physical Damage:**\n\n1. **Injury from Accidents:** The brief loss of consciousness can lead to accidents, especially if the seizure occurs during activities that require continuous attention, like walking, climbing stairs, or operating machinery. However, the risk is generally lower compared to other types of seizures because of the brief duration and the fact that muscle tone is usually maintained.\n\n2. **Status Epilepticus:** Although rare, a prolonged absence seizure or a series of absence seizures occurring close together can evolve into a condition known as absence status epilepticus. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.\n\n**Mental or Cognitive Impact:**\n\n1. **Cognitive Function:** There is evidence suggesting that frequent absence seizures, especially if not adequately controlled, can have a negative impact on cognitive function, particularly in areas such as attention and memory. The effect is more significant if seizures are frequent or if the individual experiences other types of seizures.\n\n2. **Learning and Academic Performance:** In children, absence seizures can significantly impact learning and academic performance. The brief but frequent losses of consciousness can make it difficult to follow instructions or to keep up with schoolwork, potentially leading to learning difficulties or delays.\n\n3. **Psychological Impact:** Living with absence seizures can have a psychological impact, including feelings of anxiety, embarrassment, or frustration, particularly if the seizures occur in public or in situations where the individual feels they are a nuisance or embarrassment to others.\n\n4. **Social Stigma:** Unfortunately, there is still a social stigma associated with epilepsy, which can affect an individual's self-esteem and social interactions.\n\n**Management and Treatment:**\n\nThe primary goal of treating absence seizures is to control the seizures completely, if possible, and to minimize side effects from medications. Various antiepileptic drugs are effective for absence seizures, and the choice of medication depends on several factors, including the patient's age, the severity of the seizures, and the presence of other seizure types.\n\nLifestyle adjustments, such as getting enough sleep, avoiding alcohol, and managing stress, can also help reduce the frequency of seizures.\n\nIn summary, while absence seizures themselves may not cause direct physical damage, their occurrence can lead to physical harm through accidents and may have a cognitive and psychological impact, particularly if inadequately managed. Effective treatment and management strategies are crucial to minimize these risks and ensure the best possible quality of life for individuals with absence seizures.",

Various antiepileptic drugs are effective for absence seizures, and the choice of medication depends on several factors, including the patient's age, the severity of the seizures, and the presence of other seizure types.\n\nLifestyle adjustments, such as getting enough sleep, avoiding alcohol, and managing stress, can also help reduce the frequency of seizures.\n\nIn summary, while absence seizures themselves may not cause direct physical damage, their occurrence can lead to physical harm through accidents and may have a cognitive and psychological impact, particularly if inadequately managed. Effective treatment and management strategies are crucial to minimize these risks and ensure the best possible quality of life for individuals with absence seizures.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nAbsence seizure: An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 6 to 12. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may occur with other types of seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: - Occur many times a day - Occur for weeks to months before being noticed - Interfere with school and learning - Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: - Stop walking and start again a few seconds later - Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: - Wide awake - Thinking clearly - Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: - Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing - Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.

These disorders are passed down (inherited) in families. Adrenoleukodystrophy is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait. It affects mostly males, although some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races. The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body. There are 3 major categories of disease: - Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8) - Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life - Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones Childhood cerebral type symptoms include: - Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements - Crossed eyes - Handwriting that gets worse - Difficulty at school - Difficulty understanding what people are saying - Hearing loss - Hyperactivity - Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis - Seizures - Swallowing difficulties - Visual impairment or blindness Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include: - Difficulty controlling urination - Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness - Problems with thinking speed and visual memory Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include: - Coma - Decreased appetite - Increased skin color - Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting) - Muscle weakness - Vomiting Tests for this condition include: - Blood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland - Chromosome study to look for changes (mutations) in the ABCD1 gene - MRI of the head Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition. The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs. The other forms of this disease are milder. These complications can occur: - Adrenal crisis - Vegetative state Call your health care provider if: - Your child develops symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy - Your child has X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and is getting worse Genetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition. Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is also available. It is done by testing cells from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These tests look for either a known genetic change in the family or for very long chain fatty acid levels.

It is also known as Schilder's disease or Addison-Schilder disease.\n\n**Causes and Inheritance**\n\nALD is caused by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that helps break down certain fatty acids in the brain and adrenal glands. This mutation leads to a buildup of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which damages the nerves and adrenal glands.\n\nALD is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome. This means that males are more likely to be affected, as they have only one X chromosome. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so even if one X chromosome has the mutated gene, the other X chromosome can provide a functioning copy of the gene, reducing the severity of symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ALD can vary depending on the age of onset and the severity of the disorder. Common symptoms include:\n\n1. **Adrenal insufficiency**: The adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, such as cortisol and aldosterone, leading to fatigue, weight loss, and low blood pressure.\n2. **Neurological symptoms**: Damage to the nervous system can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\t* Vision loss\n\t* Hearing loss\n\t* Seizures\n\t* Muscle weakness\n\t* Coordination and balance problems\n\t* Cognitive decline\n3. **Behavioral changes**: Some individuals with ALD may experience behavioral changes, such as:\n\t* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms\n\t* Aggression\n\t* Emotional instability\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing ALD can be challenging, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other disorders. A diagnosis is typically made based on:\n\n1. **Family history**: A history of ALD in the family can increase the likelihood of a diagnosis.\n2. **Physical examination**: A physical examination can reveal signs of adrenal insufficiency, such as skin hyperpigmentation or low blood pressure.\n3. **Blood tests**: Blood tests can measure the levels of VLCFAs, which are typically elevated in individuals with ALD.\n4. **Genetic testing**: Genetic testing can confirm the presence of the mutated ABCD1 gene.\n5. **Imaging studies**: Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, can reveal damage to the brain and adrenal glands.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nWhile there is no cure for ALD, various treatments and management strategies can help alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression:\n\n1. **Adrenal hormone replacement therapy**: Medications can replace the hormones that the adrenal glands are not producing.\n2. **Dietary therapy**: A diet low in VLCFAs and high in Lorenzo's oil (a combination of oleic acid and erucic acid) may help slow disease progression.\n3. **Speech, occupational, and physical therapy**: These therapies can help address developmental delays and cognitive decline.\n4. **Medications**: Medications can help manage seizures, behavioral changes, and other symptoms.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ALD varies depending on the age of onset and the severity of the disorder. Some individuals may experience a relatively slow progression of the disease, while others may have a more rapid decline.\n\nIt's essential to work with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals to develop a comprehensive treatment plan for the child you are working with. With proper management and support, individuals with ALD can lead fulfilling lives.\n\nI hope this information helps you better understand Adrenoleukodystrophy and provides a foundation for your work with the child.

Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence."

It is characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and ataxia (problems with balance and movement). The disorder is often referred to as \"happy puppet syndrome\" due to the characteristic smiling and laughing behavior of individuals with the condition.\n\nRegarding the ability of a person with Angelman syndrome to have children, the likelihood is extremely low due to several factors:\n\n1. **Genetic and Developmental Issues**: Individuals with Angelman syndrome often have significant developmental and intellectual disabilities, which can make it difficult for them to engage in sexual activity or form the kind of relationships that might lead to having children.

For example, if her condition is due to a mutation in the UBE3A gene that she could pass on, there's a chance her offspring could inherit the mutated gene.\n  \n- **If the parent with Angelman syndrome is the father**: The risk to offspring would likely be lower because Angelman syndrome typically involves the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. However, there is always a risk of passing on genetic mutations.\n\nIn practice, the occurrence of individuals with Angelman syndrome having children is so rare that there is limited data on the transmission of the disorder from a parent with the syndrome to their offspring. The primary concern for families with a history of Angelman syndrome is typically related to the risk of recurrence in siblings of an affected individual, which can vary depending on the underlying genetic cause.\n\nGiven the complexity and rarity of cases where individuals with Angelman syndrome might have children, genetic counseling is crucial for families affected by the disorder to understand their specific risks and the options available to them.",

Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited.

              "text": "Hairy cell leukemia (Treatment): Treatment isn't always necessary for people with hairy cell leukemia. Because this cancer progresses very slowly and sometimes doesn't progress at all, some people prefer to wait to treat their cancer only if it causes signs and symptoms. The majority of people with hairy cell leukemia eventually need treatment. If your hairy cell leukemia causes signs and symptoms, you may decide to undergo treatment. There is no cure for hairy cell leukemia. But treatments are effective at putting hairy cell leukemia in remission for years. Chemotherapy Doctors consider chemotherapy drugs the first line of treatment for hairy cell leukemia. The great majority of people will experience complete or partial remission through the use of chemotherapy. Two chemotherapy drugs are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Cladribine. Treatment for hairy cell leukemia typically begins with cladribine. You receive a continuous infusion of the drug into a vein over several days. Most people who receive cladribine experience a complete remission that can last for several years. If your hairy cell leukemia returns, you can be treated with cladribine again. Side effects of cladribine may include infection and fever. - Pentostatin (Nipent). Pentostatin causes remission rates similar to cladribine, but it's given on a different schedule. People who take pentostatin receive infusions every other week for three to six months. Side effects of pentostatin may include fever, nausea and infection. Biological treatments Biological therapy attempts to make cancer cells more recognizable to your immune system. Once your immune system identifies cancer cells as intruders, it can set about destroying your cancer. Two types of biological treatments are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Interferon. Currently, the role of interferon in hairy cell leukemia treatment is limited. You might receive interferon if chemotherapy hasn't been effective or if you can't take chemotherapy. Most people experience partial remission with interferon, which is taken for a year. Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as fever and fatigue. - Rituximab (Rituxan). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though it's sometimes used in hairy cell leukemia. If chemotherapy drugs haven't worked for you or you can't take chemotherapy, your doctor might consider rituximab. Side effects of rituximab include fever and infection. Surgery Surgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy) might be an option if your spleen ruptures or if it's enlarged and causing pain. Though removing your spleen can't cure hairy cell leukemia, it can usually restore normal blood counts. Splenectomy isn't commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia, but it may be helpful in certain situations. Any surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection."

It is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells with \"hair-like\" projections, hence the name \"hairy cell leukemia.\" These abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver, leading to a range of symptoms and complications.\n\n**Danger level and treatment**\n\nHairy cell leukemia is considered a serious disease, but it is also a rare and slow-growing cancer. With proper treatment, many people with HCL can experience a significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life. The disease can be treated with various therapies, including:\n\n1. **Chemotherapy**: Medications that target and kill cancer cells.\n2. **Immunotherapy**: Treatments that stimulate the immune system to fight cancer.\n3. **Targeted therapy**: Medications that specifically target the abnormal B cells.\n4. **Splenectomy**: Surgical removal of the spleen, which can help alleviate symptoms.\n\nThe choice of treatment depends on the individual case, the severity of the disease, and the patient's overall health.\n\n**Life expectancy**\n\nThe prognosis for Hairy cell leukemia has improved significantly over the years, thanks to advances in treatment options. While it is difficult to predict the exact life expectancy for your father, here are some general statistics:\n\n* With treatment, the median survival rate for people with HCL is around 10-15 years.\n* For patients who respond well to treatment, the 5-year survival rate is around 80-90%.\n* However, it's essential to note that each person's case is unique, and the outcome depends on various factors, such as the disease's severity, overall health, and response to treatment.\n\n**Detection and diagnosis**\n\nIn your father's case, the disease was discovered through a blood test, which is a common way to diagnose HCL. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy, which involves examining a sample of bone marrow tissue for abnormal cells.\n\n**Age and comorbidities**\n\nAt 55 years old, your father is relatively young compared to the average age of diagnosis for HCL, which is around 60-65 years. However, it's essential to consider that the presence of underlying health conditions (comorbidities) can affect the treatment outcome and overall prognosis. The study you mentioned, which examined 25,000 patients with lymphoma or leukemia, reported a mean Charlson comorbidity index of 5.39, indicating that many patients had underlying health conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, while Hairy cell leukemia is a serious disease, it is treatable, and many people can experience a significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life with proper care. It's essential to work closely with your father's healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan and monitor his progress. With the right treatment and support, your father can live for many years with HCL, and it's crucial to focus on maintaining a good quality of life while managing the disease.",

While it is difficult to predict the exact life expectancy for your father, here are some general statistics:\n\n* With treatment, the median survival rate for people with HCL is around 10-15 years.\n* For patients who respond well to treatment, the 5-year survival rate is around 80-90%.\n* However, it's essential to note that each person's case is unique, and the outcome depends on various factors, such as the disease's severity, overall health, and response to treatment.\n\n**Detection and diagnosis**\n\nIn your father's case, the disease was discovered through a blood test, which is a common way to diagnose HCL. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy, which involves examining a sample of bone marrow tissue for abnormal cells.\n\n**Age and comorbidities**\n\nAt 55 years old, your father is relatively young compared to the average age of diagnosis for HCL, which is around 60-65 years. However, it's essential to consider that the presence of underlying health conditions (comorbidities) can affect the treatment outcome and overall prognosis. The study you mentioned, which examined 25,000 patients with lymphoma or leukemia, reported a mean Charlson comorbidity index of 5.39, indicating that many patients had underlying health conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, while Hairy cell leukemia is a serious disease, it is treatable, and many people can experience a significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life with proper care. It's essential to work closely with your father's healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan and monitor his progress. With the right treatment and support, your father can live for many years with HCL, and it's crucial to focus on maintaining a good quality of life while managing the disease.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHairy cell leukemia (Treatment): Treatment isn't always necessary for people with hairy cell leukemia. Because this cancer progresses very slowly and sometimes doesn't progress at all, some people prefer to wait to treat their cancer only if it causes signs and symptoms. The majority of people with hairy cell leukemia eventually need treatment. If your hairy cell leukemia causes signs and symptoms, you may decide to undergo treatment. There is no cure for hairy cell leukemia. But treatments are effective at putting hairy cell leukemia in remission for years. Chemotherapy Doctors consider chemotherapy drugs the first line of treatment for hairy cell leukemia. The great majority of people will experience complete or partial remission through the use of chemotherapy. Two chemotherapy drugs are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Cladribine. Treatment for hairy cell leukemia typically begins with cladribine. You receive a continuous infusion of the drug into a vein over several days. Most people who receive cladribine experience a complete remission that can last for several years. If your hairy cell leukemia returns, you can be treated with cladribine again. Side effects of cladribine may include infection and fever. - Pentostatin (Nipent). Pentostatin causes remission rates similar to cladribine, but it's given on a different schedule. People who take pentostatin receive infusions every other week for three to six months. Side effects of pentostatin may include fever, nausea and infection. Biological treatments Biological therapy attempts to make cancer cells more recognizable to your immune system. Once your immune system identifies cancer cells as intruders, it can set about destroying your cancer. Two types of biological treatments are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Interferon. Currently, the role of interferon in hairy cell leukemia treatment is limited. You might receive interferon if chemotherapy hasn't been effective or if you can't take chemotherapy. Most people experience partial remission with interferon, which is taken for a year. Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as fever and fatigue. - Rituximab (Rituxan). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though it's sometimes used in hairy cell leukemia. If chemotherapy drugs haven't worked for you or you can't take chemotherapy, your doctor might consider rituximab. Side effects of rituximab include fever and infection. Surgery Surgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy) might be an option if your spleen ruptures or if it's enlarged and causing pain. Though removing your spleen can't cure hairy cell leukemia, it can usually restore normal blood counts. Splenectomy isn't commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia, but it may be helpful in certain situations. Any surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as gum disease, dry mouth or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad aroma.

You can get it if you don't brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as gum disease, dry mouth or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad aroma. Some diseases and medicines are associated with a specific breath odor. Having good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have an underlying disorder, treating it may help eliminate the breath odor.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Generalized anxiety disorder (Treatment): Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse."

            "text": "You're exploring various treatment options for managing bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Let's break down the information on TMS Therapy, ECT, and acupuncture to help you understand their potential benefits and effectiveness.\n\n**TMS Therapy (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation):**\nTMS Therapy is a non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain. It's primarily used to treat depression, but it has also shown promise in managing bipolar disorder and anxiety. Research suggests that TMS Therapy can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in individuals with bipolar disorder. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that TMS Therapy significantly improved depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar depression. While more research is needed to fully understand its effects on generalized anxiety disorder, some studies indicate that TMS Therapy may also help alleviate anxiety symptoms.\n\n**ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy):**\nECT is a medical treatment that involves the use of electrical impulses to stimulate the brain. It's often used to treat severe depression, mania, and other mental health conditions. ECT can be effective in managing bipolar disorder, particularly during acute manic or depressive episodes. However, its use for generalized anxiety disorder is less common and more controversial. Some studies suggest that ECT may help reduce anxiety symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression, but more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n**Acupuncture:**\nAcupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate healing and balance. While its effectiveness for mood disorders is still being researched, some studies suggest that acupuncture may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. A meta-analysis published in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that acupuncture had a significant antidepressant effect in patients with major depressive disorder. Additionally, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that acupuncture reduced symptoms of anxiety in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. However, it's essential to note that the quality of evidence is generally low, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of acupuncture on bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n**Using these treatments in conjunction with medication:**\nIt's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new therapies, especially if you're already taking medications for your bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. TMS Therapy, ECT, and acupuncture may be used in conjunction with medication, but it's essential to monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Your healthcare provider can help you determine the best course of treatment and ensure that any new therapies are safe and effective for you.\n\nIn summary, TMS Therapy and ECT may be effective in managing bipolar disorder, while acupuncture shows promise in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of these treatments on generalized anxiety disorder and mixed bipolar disorder. It's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your specific needs and to ensure that any new therapies are used safely and effectively in conjunction with your medication regimen.",

Do you know anything about it? Has it had success? Also wondering about ECT? Finally, I've been told acupuncture can help for mood disorders. Is that true for mixed bipolar and generalized anxiety disorder along with meds? Have you ever heard of this?\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nYou're exploring various treatment options for managing bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Let's break down the information on TMS Therapy, ECT, and acupuncture to help you understand their potential benefits and effectiveness.\n\n**TMS Therapy (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation):**\nTMS Therapy is a non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain. It's primarily used to treat depression, but it has also shown promise in managing bipolar disorder and anxiety. Research suggests that TMS Therapy can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in individuals with bipolar disorder. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that TMS Therapy significantly improved depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar depression. While more research is needed to fully understand its effects on generalized anxiety disorder, some studies indicate that TMS Therapy may also help alleviate anxiety symptoms.\n\n**ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy):**\nECT is a medical treatment that involves the use of electrical impulses to stimulate the brain. It's often used to treat severe depression, mania, and other mental health conditions. ECT can be effective in managing bipolar disorder, particularly during acute manic or depressive episodes. However, its use for generalized anxiety disorder is less common and more controversial. Some studies suggest that ECT may help reduce anxiety symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression, but more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n**Acupuncture:**\nAcupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate healing and balance. While its effectiveness for mood disorders is still being researched, some studies suggest that acupuncture may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. A meta-analysis published in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that acupuncture had a significant antidepressant effect in patients with major depressive disorder. Additionally, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that acupuncture reduced symptoms of anxiety in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. However, it's essential to note that the quality of evidence is generally low, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of acupuncture on bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n**Using these treatments in conjunction with medication:**\nIt's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new therapies, especially if you're already taking medications for your bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. TMS Therapy, ECT, and acupuncture may be used in conjunction with medication, but it's essential to monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Your healthcare provider can help you determine the best course of treatment and ensure that any new therapies are safe and effective for you.\n\nIn summary, TMS Therapy and ECT may be effective in managing bipolar disorder, while acupuncture shows promise in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of these treatments on generalized anxiety disorder and mixed bipolar disorder. It's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your specific needs and to ensure that any new therapies are used safely and effectively in conjunction with your medication regimen.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (Treatment): Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

At 84 years old, treatment options for breast cancer can be a bit more complex due to potential age-related health issues and limited life expectancy. However, I'll provide you with general information and suggestions on treatment options after surgery.\n\n**Understanding the diagnosis:**\n\n* Your mother's tumor is located in the milk duct, which is known as ductal carcinoma.\n* The small size of the tumor is a positive factor, as it may indicate a better prognosis.\n* The presence of a mass in the same breast may be related to the tumor or a separate issue, which will be evaluated during the lumpectomy.\n\n**Lumpectomy:**\n\n* A lumpectomy, also known as breast-conserving surgery, is a surgical procedure to remove the tumor and the mass.\n* This surgery aims to preserve as much of the breast tissue as possible while removing the cancerous cells.\n\n**Treatment options after surgery:**\n\nConsidering your mother's age, the treatment options after surgery may be tailored to minimize potential side effects and prioritize her quality of life. Here are some possible options:\n\n1. **Radiation therapy:**\n\t* Radiation therapy may be recommended to eliminate any remaining cancer cells in the breast.\n\t* However, for women over 80 years old, radiation therapy might not be necessary, especially if the tumor is small and hormone receptor-positive.\n2. **Hormone therapy:**\n\t* If the tumor is hormone receptor-positive (estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive), hormone therapy may be prescribed.\n\t* Hormone therapy can help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and may be a suitable option for older adults.\n3. **Chemotherapy:**\n\t* Chemotherapy is often not recommended for women over 80 years old, especially if the tumor is small and hormone receptor-positive.\n\t* However, if the tumor is aggressive or has spread to lymph nodes, chemotherapy might be considered.\n4. **Tamoxifen or other hormone-blocking medications:**\n\t* These medications can help prevent cancer recurrence and may be prescribed for hormone receptor-positive tumors.\n5. **Active surveillance:**\n\t* In some cases, active surveillance might be recommended, which involves regular monitoring with mammograms, ultrasounds, and clinical exams to track any changes in the breast.\n\n**Age-related considerations:**\n\n* Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects from cancer treatments, such as fatigue, decreased mobility, and increased risk of infections.\n* The treatment plan should take into account your mother's overall health, any existing medical conditions, and her ability to tolerate potential side effects.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\nIt's essential to discuss your mother's specific situation and treatment options with her healthcare team, including the surgeon, oncologist, and radiologist. They will help determine the best course of action based on her individual needs and health status.\n\nSome questions to ask the healthcare team:\n\n* What are the chances of cancer recurrence with and without additional treatments?\n* What are the potential side effects of each treatment option, and how will they impact my mother's quality of life?\n* Are there any clinical trials or studies that may be suitable for my mother?\n* What is the recommended follow-up schedule, and how will we monitor for any changes in the breast?\n\nRemember, every individual is unique, and the treatment plan should be tailored to your mother's specific needs and preferences.

According to the passages provided, two notable causes of peripheral neuropathy are associated with the treatment of multiple myeloma patients. \n\n1. **Carfilzomib Treatment**: The use of carfilzomib, a medication for multiple myeloma, has been linked to an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. A cohort study compared multiple myeloma patients treated with carfilzomib to those who were not and found that carfilzomib treatment was associated with a significantly increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67 (p=0.011). This indicates that patients treated with carfilzomib have a higher risk of developing peripheral neuropathy compared to those not treated with this medication.\n\n2. **Bortezomib Treatment**: Another medication, bortezomib, also used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, has been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. A cohort study examining the risk of peripheral neuropathy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients receiving bortezomib as part of their first-line therapy found that bortezomib use was significantly associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.94 (p<0.001). This suggests that patients receiving bortezomib as part of their initial treatment for multiple myeloma have a nearly two-fold increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy compared to those not receiving bortezomib.\n\nIn addition to these medication-associated risks, the passages also highlight other factors that may contribute to or be associated with peripheral neuropathy in the context of multiple myeloma and its treatment, such as age, history of metastatic solid tumors, and peripheral vascular disease. However, the primary causes of peripheral neuropathy identified in these passages are related to the treatments (carfilzomib and bortezomib) rather than these secondary factors.\n\nIn general, peripheral neuropathy can result from various causes, including but not limited to:\n- **Diabetes**: A leading cause of peripheral neuropathy, where high blood glucose levels damage nerve fibers.\n- **Trauma**: Injuries from accidents, falls, or sports can cause peripheral neuropathy.\n- **Infections**: Certain infections, such as Lyme disease, shingles, or HIV, can lead to peripheral neuropathy.\n- **Autoimmune diseases**: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can cause peripheral neuropathy.\n- **Medications**: As seen in the passages, certain medications, including those used for chemotherapy, can cause peripheral neuropathy.\n- **Vitamin deficiencies**: Lack of vitamins, especially B vitamins, can lead to peripheral neuropathy.\n- **Exposure to toxins**: Exposure to certain toxins, such as heavy metals or chemicals, can damage nerves.\n\nIt's essential for individuals experiencing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet, to consult a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.",

People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more. Specific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include: - Antibiotics. These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic. - Cough medicine. This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it's a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest. - Fever reducers/pain relievers. You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort. These include drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Hospitalization You may need to be hospitalized if: - You are older than age 65 - You are confused about time, people or places - Your kidney function has declined - Your systolic blood pressure is below 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or your diastolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg or below - Your breathing is rapid (30 breaths or more a minute) - You need breathing assistance - Your temperature is below normal - Your heart rate is below 50 or above 100 You may be admitted to the intensive care unit if you need to be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator) or if your symptoms are severe.

The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\n\n**Is Pneumonia Infectious?**\n\nSome forms of pneumonia are infectious, meaning they can be spread from person to person. However, not all types of pneumonia are contagious. The risk of transmission depends on the type of pneumonia:\n\n- **Bacterial pneumonia**: This can be contagious, but the risk of transmission is generally low. It's more likely to spread in people who live in close proximity, such as family members.\n- **Viral pneumonia**: This is more likely to be contagious than bacterial pneumonia, as respiratory viruses are often spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n- **Fungal pneumonia**: This is not typically contagious from person to person but can be spread through the inhalation of fungal spores from the environment.\n\n**Can Pneumonia be Totally Cured?**\n\nYes, pneumonia can be cured with appropriate treatment. The type of treatment depends on the cause of the pneumonia:\n\n- **Bacterial pneumonia**: This is typically treated with antibiotics. Most people start to feel better within a few days of starting treatment, but it's essential to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by the doctor.\n- **Viral pneumonia**: Since antibiotics are ineffective against viruses, treatment for viral pneumonia focuses on relieving symptoms (such as cough and fever) and supporting the body's immune system while it fights off the infection. Antiviral medications may be prescribed for certain types of viral pneumonia.\n- **Fungal pneumonia**: This is treated with antifungal medications.\n\n**How to Help Your Friend Get Cured**\n\n1. **Encourage Medical Care**: The most important step is to ensure your friend seeks medical care from a healthcare professional. A doctor can diagnose the type of pneumonia and prescribe the appropriate treatment.\n\n2. **Rest and Hydration**: Encourage your friend to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. This can help the body recover from the infection.\n\n3. **Follow Treatment Plan**: It's crucial that your friend follows the treatment plan as directed by the healthcare provider, including completing the full course of antibiotics (if prescribed).\n\n4. **Supportive Care**: Offer to help your friend with daily tasks that may be challenging while they are recovering, such as cooking, cleaning, or running errands.\n\n5. **Prevention of Complications**: Ensure your friend knows the signs of complications or worsening symptoms, such as increased difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a persistent high fever, and seeks immediate medical attention if these occur.\n\n6. **Emotional Support**: Being sick can be stressful and isolating. Offer emotional support and reassurance to help your friend cope with the illness.\n\nRemember, marrying someone with pneumonia does not necessarily pose a risk to you if you take basic precautions to prevent the spread of infection, such as washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with your friend until they are no longer contagious (usually after they have been on appropriate antibiotics for at least 24-48 hours), and ensuring good ventilation in shared living spaces.\n\nIt's also important to discuss the future and any concerns you may have openly with your friend and consider seeking advice from a healthcare provider or a counselor.",

People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more. Specific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include: - Antibiotics. These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic. - Cough medicine. This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it's a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest. - Fever reducers/pain relievers. You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort. These include drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Hospitalization You may need to be hospitalized if: - You are older than age 65 - You are confused about time, people or places - Your kidney function has declined - Your systolic blood pressure is below 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or your diastolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg or below - Your breathing is rapid (30 breaths or more a minute) - You need breathing assistance - Your temperature is below normal - Your heart rate is below 50 or above 100 You may be admitted to the intensive care unit if you need to be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator) or if your symptoms are severe. Children may be hospitalized if: - They are younger than age 2 months - They are lethargic or excessively sleepy - They have trouble breathing - They have low blood oxygen levels - They appear dehydrated\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Migraine and other types of headaches - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome - Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms."

Let's break down each condition and potential treatments to better understand how they can be managed, especially concerning the muscular dystrophy aspect and its impact on your heart, legs, feet, shoulders, and arms.\n\n### Cushing's Syndrome\nCushing's syndrome is a medical condition caused by an excess of cortisol in the body. Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a variety of roles, including helping the body respond to stress and regulating blood sugar. The excess cortisol can be due to a variety of reasons, such as long-term use of corticosteroid medications or a tumor causing the adrenal gland to overproduce cortisol.\n\n**Treatment for Cushing's Syndrome:**\n- The treatment depends on the cause. If it's due to medication, the dose might be adjusted or an alternative medication might be prescribed.\n- For Cushing's syndrome caused by a tumor, surgery, radiation, or medication to decrease cortisol production might be necessary.\n- Managing symptoms such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and osteoporosis is also crucial.\n\n### Fibromyalgia\nFibromyalgia is a long-term condition characterized by widespread pain in the muscles and bones, areas of tenderness, and general fatigue.

Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Migraine and other types of headaches - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome - Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Cervical cancer: Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix. The cervix is\u00a0the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer\u00a0usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: - Having sex at an early age - Having multiple sexual partners - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: - Not getting the HPV vaccine - Being economically disadvantaged - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: - Back pain - Bone pain or fractures - Fatigue - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina - Leg pain - Loss of appetite - Pelvic pain - Single swollen leg - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions: - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis. - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination. - A procedure called a\u00a0cone biopsy may also be done. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include: - Chest x-ray - CT scan of the pelvis - Cystoscopy - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on: - The stage of the cancer - The size and shape of the tumor - The woman's age and general health - Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include: - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed. Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including: - Type of cervical cancer - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread) - Age and general health - If the cancer comes back after treatment Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include: - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you: - Have not had regular Pap smears - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

The cervix is\u00a0the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer\u00a0usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: - Having sex at an early age - Having multiple sexual partners - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: - Not getting the HPV vaccine - Being economically disadvantaged - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: - Back pain - Bone pain or fractures - Fatigue - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina - Leg pain - Loss of appetite - Pelvic pain - Single swollen leg - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions: - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis. - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination. - A procedure called a\u00a0cone biopsy may also be done. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include: - Chest x-ray - CT scan of the pelvis - Cystoscopy - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on: - The stage of the cancer - The size and shape of the tumor - The woman's age and general health - Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include: - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed. Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including: - Type of cervical cancer - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread) - Age and general health - If the cancer comes back after treatment Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include: - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you: - Have not had regular Pap smears - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

              "text": "Diabetes type 2 - meal planning (Function): Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has: - Food from all the food groups - Fewer calories - About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack - Healthy fats Along with healthy eating, you can help\u00a0keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. Persons with type 2 diabetes are often overweight. Losing just 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 30 to 60 minutes of walking per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food. The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day). Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition. The following tips can help your child stay on track: - No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep it in target range. - Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control. - Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk. PLANNING MEALS Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you. When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices. A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate. EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. VEGETABLES (2\u00bd to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day) Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro.\u00a0Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable. FRUITS (1\u00bd to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day) Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups. GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day) There are 2 types of grains: - Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa. - Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice. Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast. PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6\u00bd ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day) Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil. DAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day) Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label. OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day) Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature. Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter. Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters). WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS? If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you. Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small. Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets: - Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others. - Eat sweets that are sugar-free. - Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size. YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you."

The increase in blood glucose levels overnight, despite not eating, is often referred to as the \"dawn phenomenon\" or, in some cases, the \"Somogyi effect.\" However, these two phenomena have different underlying causes and implications for management.\n\n1. **Dawn Phenomenon**: This is a natural increase in blood glucose that occurs in the early morning hours, typically between 2 and 8 am, due to the release of certain hormones such as cortisol, glucagon, and epinephrine. These hormones raise blood glucose levels to help prepare the body for the day ahead. The dawn phenomenon can be more pronounced in people with diabetes.\n\n2. **Somogyi Effect**: This phenomenon occurs when blood glucose levels are too low during the night (hypoglycemia), prompting the body to release stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones then cause the liver to release stored glucose (glycogen), leading to high blood glucose levels in the morning.\n\nGiven your scenario, where you have a lower blood glucose reading before bed (94 mg/dL) and a higher reading in the morning (165 mg/dL) without consuming any food overnight, here are some steps you can consider to manage your morning glucose levels:\n\n### Dietary Adjustments\n- **Carbohydrate Distribution**: Ensure that your dinner includes a balance of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. This balance can help slow down the digestion and absorption of glucose, potentially reducing the peak and subsequent drop in blood glucose levels.\n- **Fiber Intake**: Increasing fiber consumption, especially soluble fiber found in foods like oats, barley, fruits, and vegetables, can help slow the absorption of glucose and improve insulin sensitivity.\n\n### Lifestyle Changes\n- **Physical Activity**: Engage in some form of physical activity after dinner, like a short walk, to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by muscles, which can help lower blood glucose levels.\n- **Stress Management**: Stress can elevate cortisol levels, contributing to higher glucose readings. Practices like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises can help manage stress.\n\n### Medication Adjustments\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: If you're on diabetes medications, consult with your healthcare provider about possibly adjusting the timing or dosage of your medications. For example, taking a long-acting insulin or a medication that helps regulate liver glucose release at dinner time might be beneficial.\n\n### Monitoring and Testing\n- **More Frequent Testing**: Temporarily testing your blood glucose at 2 or 3 am for a few nights can help determine if you're experiencing hypoglycemia during the night (Somogyi effect) or if the dawn phenomenon is the primary issue.\n- **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)**: If available and recommended by your healthcare provider, using a CGM can provide detailed insights into your glucose levels throughout the night and day, helping you identify patterns and make informed decisions.\n\n### Conclusion\nManaging diabetes and reducing morning blood glucose levels requires a multi-faceted approach that considers diet, physical activity, stress management, and possibly medication adjustments. It's crucial to work closely with your healthcare team to develop a personalized plan that addresses your specific needs and circumstances.",

To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has: - Food from all the food groups - Fewer calories - About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack - Healthy fats Along with healthy eating, you can help\u00a0keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. Persons with type 2 diabetes are often overweight. Losing just 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 30 to 60 minutes of walking per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food. The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day). Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition. The following tips can help your child stay on track: - No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep it in target range. - Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control. - Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk. PLANNING MEALS Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you. When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices. A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate. EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. VEGETABLES (2\u00bd to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day) Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro.\u00a0Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable. FRUITS (1\u00bd to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day) Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups. GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day) There are 2 types of grains: - Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa. - Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice. Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast. PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6\u00bd ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day) Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil. DAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day) Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label. OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day) Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature. Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter. Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters). WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS? If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you. Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small. Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets: - Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others. - Eat sweets that are sugar-free. - Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size. YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team.

It's great that you want to support her. Here's some information to help you get started:\n\n**Understanding Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA):**\n\nLCA is a genetic eye disorder that affects the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It is usually present at birth or develops in early childhood, leading to severe visual impairment or blindness. LCA is caused by mutations in one of several genes that are crucial for the development and function of the retina.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\nThe primary symptom of LCA is significant visual impairment or blindness, which may be apparent at birth or become noticeable in the first few years of life. Other symptoms can include:\n\n* Poor vision or blindness\n* Sensitivity to light (photophobia)\n* Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)\n* Delayed development of motor skills\n\n**Support and Assistance:**\n\nWhile there is currently no cure for LCA, there are various ways to support your cousin and help her navigate her daily life:\n\n1. **Low Vision Rehabilitation:** Encourage your cousin to consult a low vision specialist or an occupational therapist who can help her develop strategies to adapt to her vision loss.\n2. **Assistive Technology:** Explore assistive technologies, such as canes, walkers, or electronic devices with accessibility features, to help your cousin with daily tasks and mobility.\n3. **Braille and Tactile Graphics:** If your cousin's vision loss is severe, consider introducing her to Braille or tactile graphics to improve her literacy and communication skills.\n4. **Emotional Support:** Living with a severe visual impairment can be emotionally challenging. Offer emotional support, and encourage your cousin to connect with support groups or counseling services if needed.\n5. **Medical Follow-up:** Regular eye exams and follow-up appointments with an ophthalmologist or a genetic counselor can help monitor your cousin's condition and provide guidance on managing her vision loss.\n6. **Genetic Counseling:** If your cousin is considering having children, genetic counseling can provide information about the risk of passing the condition to future generations.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* National Eye Institute (NEI): [www.nei.nih.gov](http://www.nei.nih.gov)\n* American Foundation for the Blind (AFB): [www.afb.org](http://www.afb.org)\n* Foundation Fighting Blindness (FFB): [www.fightingblindness.org](http://www.fightingblindness.org)\n* Local low vision rehabilitation centers or support groups\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1.

These cramps can be excruciating and debilitating.\n3. **Gradual progression**: Your symptoms started at night but have now progressed to occur during the day, which is a common pattern in SPS. The stiffness and rigidity can worsen over time, affecting more areas of the body.\n\n**Other symptoms you've mentioned:**\n\n1. **Involvement of back, neck, and voice box**: SPS can affect various muscle groups, including those in the back, neck, and voice box (larynx). This can lead to difficulties with speech, swallowing, and breathing.\n2. **Chest area restriction**: The severe stiffness and rigidity in your chest area can restrict your breathing, leading to shallow breathing. This is a concerning symptom that requires medical attention to prevent respiratory complications.\n3. **Involuntary stretching**: The phenomenon of stretching out involuntarily throughout your body is a characteristic feature of SPS.

Locked-in syndrome is a rare and devastating condition that can be very challenging for both the patient and their loved ones. I'll try to provide you with some guidance and support.\n\n**Understanding Locked-in Syndrome:**\n\nLocked-in syndrome is a condition in which a person is aware and awake, but cannot move or speak due to complete paralysis of all voluntary muscles except for the eyes. This is often caused by a traumatic brain injury, brainstem stroke, or other conditions that damage the brainstem.\n\n**Coping with Locked-in Syndrome:**\n\nI can only imagine how difficult this must be for your brother and your family. Here are some suggestions that may help:\n\n1. **Seek professional help:** Ensure that your brother is receiving proper medical care from a multidisciplinary team, including neurologists, rehabilitation specialists, and therapists.\n2. **Communication strategies:** Since your brother can only communicate through eye movements, it's essential to establish a reliable communication system. This can include eye-tracking devices, blink-coded communication, or other methods that allow him to express his needs and wants.\n3. **Rehabilitation and therapy:** Although the chances of significant recovery are low, rehabilitation and therapy can still help improve your brother's quality of life. This may include physical therapy to maintain range of motion, occupational therapy to adapt to his condition, and speech therapy to develop alternative communication methods.\n4. **Emotional support:** Living with locked-in syndrome can be emotionally taxing for both the patient and their caregivers. Consider seeking counseling or therapy to cope with the emotional challenges and stress.\n5. **Respite care:** Don't forget to take care of yourself and other family members. Respite care can provide temporary relief and allow you to recharge.\n6. **Support groups:** Connecting with others who are going through similar experiences can be incredibly helpful. Look for online support groups or local organizations that provide resources and guidance for families affected by locked-in syndrome.\n7. **Explore technological advancements:** There are ongoing advancements in technology, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), that may potentially help improve communication and quality of life for individuals with locked-in syndrome.\n\n**Resources:**\n\nSome organizations that may be able to provide additional support and guidance include:\n\n* The Locked-In Syndrome Association\n* The Brain Injury Association of America\n* The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)\n* The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)\n\n**God bless you and your family:**\n\nI want to acknowledge the emotional toll this condition can take on families. It's essential to prioritize your well-being and seek support when needed. Remember that you're not alone, and there are resources available to help you navigate this challenging journey.\n\nPlease feel free to share more about your brother's situation, and I'll do my best to provide more tailored guidance and support.",

              "text": "congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1 in 2,500 newborns. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.

The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1 in 2,500 newborns. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.

              "text": "Colon cancer (Treatment): The type of treatment your doctor recommends will depend largely on the stage of your cancer. The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy may be used before surgery as well, with the goal of shrinking the cancer before an operation. Chemotherapy before surgery is more common in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. Chemotherapy can also be given to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells, to shrink large tumors before an operation so that they can be removed more easily, or to relieve symptoms of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Radiation therapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options for the initial management of rectal cancer followed by surgery. Targeted drug therapy Drugs that target specific malfunctions that allow cancer cells to grow are available to people with advanced colon cancer, including: - Bevacizumab (Avastin) - Cetuximab (Erbitux) - Panitumumab (Vectibix) - Ramucirumab (Cyramza) - Regorafenib (Stivarga) - Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) Targeted drugs can be given along with chemotherapy or alone. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs. Until more is known, doctors carefully weigh the possible benefit of targeted drugs against the risk of side effects and the cost when deciding whether to use these treatments. Immunotherapy Some patients with advanced colon cancer have a chance to benefit from immunotherapy with antibodies such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo). Whether a colon cancer has the chance to respond to these immunotherapies can be determined by a specific test of the tumor tissue. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving."

However, it's essential to approach claims of a \"cure\" with caution, especially when seen in advertisements or commercials. The medical field, particularly when it comes to serious diseases like cancer, relies heavily on evidence-based treatments that have undergone rigorous testing and peer review.\n\nThe passages you provided discuss studies related to colon cancer and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a condition that can increase the risk of colon cancer, but they do not mention a specific \"cure\" for colon cancer. These studies focus on the risks associated with PSC, the effects of certain medications on patients with concurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and PSC, and the lack of significant differences in outcomes such as colon cancer risk when using oral vancomycin.\n\nGiven the complexity and variability of cancer, including colon cancer, there is no single \"cure\" that applies universally. Treatments for colon cancer can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, among others. The choice of treatment depends on the stage of the cancer, the overall health of the patient, and other factors.\n\nIt's crucial for your father to consult with his healthcare provider or an oncologist about any potential treatments or clinical trials that might be appropriate for his specific situation. They can provide guidance based on the latest scientific evidence and medical standards.\n\nAdditionally, if your father saw a commercial about a colon cancer cure, it's possible that it was referring to an experimental treatment, a clinical trial, or perhaps a misleading advertisement. The medical community and regulatory agencies like the FDA closely monitor and evaluate new treatments to ensure their safety and efficacy.\n\nFor reliable information on colon cancer treatments and any potential breakthroughs, you can consult reputable sources such as the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, or peer-reviewed medical journals. Remember, it's always best to verify information through trusted sources to avoid misinformation.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I wish your father the best in his treatment and care.",

The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy may be used before surgery as well, with the goal of shrinking the cancer before an operation. Chemotherapy before surgery is more common in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. Chemotherapy can also be given to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells, to shrink large tumors before an operation so that they can be removed more easily, or to relieve symptoms of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Radiation therapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options for the initial management of rectal cancer followed by surgery. Targeted drug therapy Drugs that target specific malfunctions that allow cancer cells to grow are available to people with advanced colon cancer, including: - Bevacizumab (Avastin) - Cetuximab (Erbitux) - Panitumumab (Vectibix) - Ramucirumab (Cyramza) - Regorafenib (Stivarga) - Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) Targeted drugs can be given along with chemotherapy or alone. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs. Until more is known, doctors carefully weigh the possible benefit of targeted drugs against the risk of side effects and the cost when deciding whether to use these treatments. Immunotherapy Some patients with advanced colon cancer have a chance to benefit from immunotherapy with antibodies such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo). Whether a colon cancer has the chance to respond to these immunotherapies can be determined by a specific test of the tumor tissue. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. DMD causes progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of skeletal and heart muscles. [1] Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. The calves may be enlarged. Children with DMD may have an unusual walk and difficulty running, climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor. [2] DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills. [3] Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. [2] DMD is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the DMD gene . The DMD gene codes for the protein dystrophin. [1] [2] Dystrophin is mainly made in skeletal and heart muscle cells , but a small amount is also made in nerve cells\u00a0(neurons) in specific parts of the brain. [3] DMD is\u00a0 inherited in an X-linked recessive \u00a0pattern; however, it\u00a0may also\u00a0occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. [2]\u00a0 While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. [4] Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood. [2] [3] Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) is also caused by mutations in the DMD gene. People with BMD have less severe symptoms than DMD. In addition, symptoms start later in childhood or in adolescence and progress more slowly. [1] Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually noticed in boys between 1 to 6 years of age. There is a steady decline in muscle strength between the ages of 6 and 11 years. By age 10, braces may be required for walking, and by age 13, most boys with DMD are confined to a wheelchair. The signs and symptoms are as follows: [1] [2] [3] Taking longer to learn to sit, stand, or walk on own, which is known as delayed motor development. The mean age for walking in boys with DMD is 18 months. Having a waddling walk or gait, difficulty climbing stairs, and running due to progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvic muscles and progressive loss of muscle mass (wasting or atrophy).\u00a0 Difficulty getting up from the floor. Child may walk his hands up his legs to stand which is known as the\u00a0Gower maneuver. Enlargement of calf muscles due to the calf muscle cells being\u00a0 Muscle weakness first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. Tight or rigid joints (also known as contractures ) may develop as muscle loss progresses. If not treated, these will become severe, causing discomfort and restricting mobility and flexibility. Contractures can affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. Scoliosis may develop within several years of being confined to a wheelchair. By the early teens, the respiratory and heart muscles are also affected. Breathing problems due to weakness of the diaphragm and the other muscles supporting the operation of the lungs. Skeletal changes, such as scoliosis, may also increase breathing problems. Breathing problems may become life threatening. Progressive enlargement of the heart ( cardiomyopathy ) develops. This stops the heart from pumping blood efficiently, and becomes life-threatening in many cases. Learning and memory issues (cognitive impairment) may occur in some cases, but do not worsen as the DMD progresses. Communication may be more difficult for some. Social behavior may be affected, as well as the ability to read facial cues.\u00a0\u00a0 The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene . The DMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. Dystophin is primarily made in the muscle cells of the heart and skeletal muscle. The main job of dystrophin in muscle cells is to help stabilize and protect muscle fibers. [1] [2] [3]\u00a0 DMD is caused by genetic changes in the DMD gene that stop any functional dystrophin from being made. [2] When dystrophin is missing, the muscle cells become damaged more easily. In response to the damage, inflammation occurs, which only worsens the process. Over time, the muscle cells without dystrophin weaken and die, leading to the muscle weakness and heart problems seen in DMD. [2] [3] The non-progressive memory and learning problems, as well as social behavioral problems, in some boys with DMD are most likely linked to loss of dystrophin in the neurons of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain where dystrophin is normally produced in small amounts, but at this point it is not known why this occurs and why only some people with DMD have these problems. [3]\u00a0 Different genetic changes in the DMD gene can cause a spectrum of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. The dystrophinopathies can range from very mild symptoms to the more severe symptoms seen in people with DMD. Other dystrophinopathies include Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). [2] Genetic changes causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be passed down in families. The DMD gene is located on the X chromosome , one of the two types of sex chromosomes . Males have an X and a Y chromosome ; whereas females have two X chromosomes . Since males only have one X chromosome, they also only have one copy of the DMD gene. If this copy has a genetic change that causes DMD, the male will have DMD. Males get their X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father. [1] [2]\u00a0 Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the DMD gene. Having two changed copies of the DMD gene that can cause DMD is unlikely, but would cause DMD in females. A female with only one changed copy of the DMD gene is called a \" carrier \". She can pass on the changed gene, but usually does not have symptoms of DMD. Carriers of changes in the DMD gene that can cause DMD are at an increased risk of developing heart problems, including cardiomyopathy . In addition, due to a process called X-inactivation , in rare cases, female carriers may have mild, moderate, or severe DMD. [2] If a man with DMD has children, all of his daughters will be carriers. Since boys inherit the Y chromosome from their father, sons will not inherit DMD from their fathers, even if the father has DMD. [1] [2] DMD DMD DMD DMD A child's doctor may suspect Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys who have the signs and symptoms of DMD, including progressive muscle weakness. Family history is also important. Blood tests can be used to check for\u00a0 increased levels of certain special proteins called muscle enzymes in the blood which can leak from damaged muscles. Most commonly, the blood level of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) is checked, but a doctor may also check the blood levels of transaminases such as aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Finding a change in the DMD gene that can cause DMD through genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of DMD. [2] [5]\u00a0\u00a0 Testing for DMD may include: [2] [5]\u00a0 Blood test which measures the levels of serum creatine phosphokinase Molecular genetic testing Electromyography Muscle biopsy is rarely used to diagnose DMD due to the decreased cost and higher accuracy of genetic testing. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life.\u00a0An enlarged, weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a\u00a0 heart transplant\u00a0may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. [2] [6] Physical therapy Steroids\u00a0( corticosteroids ) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function. Steroid options include: [2] [6] Prednisone \u00a0is\u00a0a steroid that has been shown to extend the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain, high blood pressure , behavior changes, and delayed growth. Deflazacort (another form of prednisone), is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects and was recently approved in the United States by the FDA. Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, also has similar benefits to prednisone, but with fewer side effects. Management Guidelines Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

            "text": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Here's an overview of the mode of inheritance, symptoms, treatments, support groups, and relative cost to families:\n\n**Mode of Inheritance:**\nDMD is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means the genes responsible for the condition are located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. The mutation that causes DMD is typically inherited from the mother, who is usually a carrier of the disease. Sons of carrier mothers have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene and developing DMD, while daughters have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene and becoming carriers themselves.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nThe symptoms of DMD typically become apparent in early childhood, around 2-5 years of age. They may include:\n\n1. Muscle weakness: This is the primary symptom of DMD, and it progresses rapidly.\n2. Delayed motor skills: Children with DMD may have difficulty walking, running, or performing other physical activities.\n3. Muscle wasting: As the disease progresses, muscles become wasted and weakened.\n4. Respiratory problems: Weakness of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles can lead to breathing difficulties.\n5. Cardiac problems: DMD can also lead to cardiomyopathy, a condition that weakens the heart muscle.\n6. Cognition and behavior: Some individuals with DMD may experience cognitive and behavioral difficulties, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder.\n\n**Treatments:**\nWhile there is no cure for DMD, various treatments can help manage its symptoms and slow its progression. These include:\n\n1. Corticosteroids: These medications can help slow muscle degeneration and improve strength.\n2. Physical therapy: Regular exercise and physical therapy can help maintain muscle function and mobility.\n3. Occupational therapy: This type of therapy can help individuals with DMD adapt to their physical limitations and maintain independence.\n4. Respiratory care: Ventilators and other respiratory support devices can help manage breathing difficulties.\n5. Cardiac care: Regular monitoring and treatment of cardiomyopathy can help manage cardiac problems.\n6. Gene therapy: Researchers are exploring gene therapy as a potential treatment for DMD, which involves replacing the faulty dystrophin gene with a healthy one.\n\n**Support Groups:**\nSeveral organizations provide support and resources for individuals with DMD and their families, including:\n\n1. Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA): The MDA offers a range of programs and services, including support groups, summer camps, and research funding.\n2. Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD): PPMD is a nonprofit organization that provides support, education, and advocacy for families affected by DMD.\n3. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Research Foundation (DMDRF): The DMDRF is a nonprofit organization that funds research and provides support for individuals with DMD and their families.\n\n**Relative Cost to Family:**\nThe cost of caring for an individual with DMD can be significant, and it may include:\n\n1. Medical expenses: The cost of medical care, including medications, hospitalizations, and respiratory support devices, can be substantial.\n2. Therapy and rehabilitation: Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can be expensive, especially if not covered by insurance.\n3. Equipment and adaptations: Families may need to purchase specialized equipment, such as wheelchairs, ventilators, and communication devices.\n4. Home modifications: Families may need to modify their homes to accommodate their child's physical needs, which can include installing ramps, widening doorways, and creating accessible bathrooms.\n5. Loss of income: Caregivers may need to reduce their work hours or take time off to care for their child, which can result in a loss of income.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Medical Economics, the estimated annual cost of caring for an individual with DMD is around $50,000 to $100,000. However, this cost can vary widely depending on the individual's specific needs and the availability of insurance coverage.\n\nIn conclusion, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a complex and costly genetic disorder that requires comprehensive care and support. While there is no cure for DMD, various treatments and therapies can help manage its symptoms and improve quality of life. Support groups and organizations can provide valuable resources and guidance for families affected by DMD.",

Loss of income: Caregivers may need to reduce their work hours or take time off to care for their child, which can result in a loss of income.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Medical Economics, the estimated annual cost of caring for an individual with DMD is around $50,000 to $100,000. However, this cost can vary widely depending on the individual's specific needs and the availability of insurance coverage.\n\nIn conclusion, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a complex and costly genetic disorder that requires comprehensive care and support. While there is no cure for DMD, various treatments and therapies can help manage its symptoms and improve quality of life. Support groups and organizations can provide valuable resources and guidance for families affected by DMD.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. DMD causes progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of skeletal and heart muscles. [1] Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. The calves may be enlarged. Children with DMD may have an unusual walk and difficulty running, climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor. [2] DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills. [3] Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. [2] DMD is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the DMD gene . The DMD gene codes for the protein dystrophin. [1] [2] Dystrophin is mainly made in skeletal and heart muscle cells , but a small amount is also made in nerve cells\u00a0(neurons) in specific parts of the brain. [3] DMD is\u00a0 inherited in an X-linked recessive \u00a0pattern; however, it\u00a0may also\u00a0occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. [2]\u00a0 While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. [4] Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood. [2] [3] Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) is also caused by mutations in the DMD gene. People with BMD have less severe symptoms than DMD. In addition, symptoms start later in childhood or in adolescence and progress more slowly. [1] Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually noticed in boys between 1 to 6 years of age. There is a steady decline in muscle strength between the ages of 6 and 11 years. By age 10, braces may be required for walking, and by age 13, most boys with DMD are confined to a wheelchair. The signs and symptoms are as follows: [1] [2] [3] Taking longer to learn to sit, stand, or walk on own, which is known as delayed motor development. The mean age for walking in boys with DMD is 18 months. Having a waddling walk or gait, difficulty climbing stairs, and running due to progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvic muscles and progressive loss of muscle mass (wasting or atrophy).\u00a0 Difficulty getting up from the floor. Child may walk his hands up his legs to stand which is known as the\u00a0Gower maneuver. Enlargement of calf muscles due to the calf muscle cells being\u00a0 Muscle weakness first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. Tight or rigid joints (also known as contractures ) may develop as muscle loss progresses. If not treated, these will become severe, causing discomfort and restricting mobility and flexibility. Contractures can affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. Scoliosis may develop within several years of being confined to a wheelchair. By the early teens, the respiratory and heart muscles are also affected. Breathing problems due to weakness of the diaphragm and the other muscles supporting the operation of the lungs. Skeletal changes, such as scoliosis, may also increase breathing problems. Breathing problems may become life threatening. Progressive enlargement of the heart ( cardiomyopathy ) develops. This stops the heart from pumping blood efficiently, and becomes life-threatening in many cases. Learning and memory issues (cognitive impairment) may occur in some cases, but do not worsen as the DMD progresses. Communication may be more difficult for some. Social behavior may be affected, as well as the ability to read facial cues.\u00a0\u00a0 The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene . The DMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. Dystophin is primarily made in the muscle cells of the heart and skeletal muscle. The main job of dystrophin in muscle cells is to help stabilize and protect muscle fibers. [1] [2] [3]\u00a0 DMD is caused by genetic changes in the DMD gene that stop any functional dystrophin from being made. [2] When dystrophin is missing, the muscle cells become damaged more easily. In response to the damage, inflammation occurs, which only worsens the process. Over time, the muscle cells without dystrophin weaken and die, leading to the muscle weakness and heart problems seen in DMD. [2] [3] The non-progressive memory and learning problems, as well as social behavioral problems, in some boys with DMD are most likely linked to loss of dystrophin in the neurons of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain where dystrophin is normally produced in small amounts, but at this point it is not known why this occurs and why only some people with DMD have these problems. [3]\u00a0 Different genetic changes in the DMD gene can cause a spectrum of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. The dystrophinopathies can range from very mild symptoms to the more severe symptoms seen in people with DMD. Other dystrophinopathies include Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). [2] Genetic changes causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be passed down in families. The DMD gene is located on the X chromosome , one of the two types of sex chromosomes . Males have an X and a Y chromosome ; whereas females have two X chromosomes . Since males only have one X chromosome, they also only have one copy of the DMD gene. If this copy has a genetic change that causes DMD, the male will have DMD. Males get their X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father. [1] [2]\u00a0 Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the DMD gene. Having two changed copies of the DMD gene that can cause DMD is unlikely, but would cause DMD in females. A female with only one changed copy of the DMD gene is called a \" carrier \". She can pass on the changed gene, but usually does not have symptoms of DMD. Carriers of changes in the DMD gene that can cause DMD are at an increased risk of developing heart problems, including cardiomyopathy . In addition, due to a process called X-inactivation , in rare cases, female carriers may have mild, moderate, or severe DMD. [2] If a man with DMD has children, all of his daughters will be carriers. Since boys inherit the Y chromosome from their father, sons will not inherit DMD from their fathers, even if the father has DMD. [1] [2] DMD DMD DMD DMD A child's doctor may suspect Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys who have the signs and symptoms of DMD, including progressive muscle weakness. Family history is also important. Blood tests can be used to check for\u00a0 increased levels of certain special proteins called muscle enzymes in the blood which can leak from damaged muscles. Most commonly, the blood level of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) is checked, but a doctor may also check the blood levels of transaminases such as aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Finding a change in the DMD gene that can cause DMD through genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of DMD. [2] [5]\u00a0\u00a0 Testing for DMD may include: [2] [5]\u00a0 Blood test which measures the levels of serum creatine phosphokinase Molecular genetic testing Electromyography Muscle biopsy is rarely used to diagnose DMD due to the decreased cost and higher accuracy of genetic testing. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life.\u00a0An enlarged, weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a\u00a0 heart transplant\u00a0may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. [2] [6] Physical therapy Steroids\u00a0( corticosteroids ) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function. Steroid options include: [2] [6] Prednisone \u00a0is\u00a0a steroid that has been shown to extend the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain, high blood pressure , behavior changes, and delayed growth. Deflazacort (another form of prednisone), is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects and was recently approved in the United States by the FDA. Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, also has similar benefits to prednisone, but with fewer side effects. Management Guidelines Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

              "text": "Esophageal cancer: Esophageal cancer is cancer that starts in the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope. Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include any of the following: - Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation) - Chest pain not related to eating - Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids - Heartburn - Vomiting blood - Weight loss Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include: - Barium swallow - Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease) - Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease) - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy - PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible) Stool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool. Upper endoscopy (EGD) will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery will be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using: - Open surgery, during which one or two larger incisions are made. - Minimally invasive surgery, during which a 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions. Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus. Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable. Beside a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include: - Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open. - A feeding tube into the stomach. - Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival. When the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Complications may include: - Pneumonia - Severe weight loss from not eating enough Call your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better. Also call if you have other symptoms of esophageal cancer. To reduce your risk of cancer of the esophagus: - DO NOT smoke - Limit or DO NOT drink alcoholic beverages - Get checked by your doctor if you have severe GERD - Get regular checkups if you have Barrett esophagus Updated by: Subodh K.

It is a rare but serious type of cancer that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated early.\n\n**Types of Esophageal Cancer**\n\nThere are two main types of esophageal cancer:\n\n1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: This type of cancer occurs in the squamous cells that line the esophagus. It is the most common type of esophageal cancer and is often linked to smoking and alcohol consumption.\n2. **Adenocarcinoma**: This type of cancer occurs in the glandular cells that line the esophagus. It is more common in people with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is often linked to obesity and diet.\n\n**Symptoms of Esophageal Cancer**\n\nThe symptoms of esophageal cancer can vary, but common symptoms include:\n\n* Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n* Pain or discomfort when swallowing\n* Weight loss\n* Abdominal pain\n* Anemia (low red blood cell count)\n* Hoarseness or coughing\n\n**Risk Factors for Esophageal Cancer**\n\nCertain factors can increase a person's risk of developing esophageal cancer, including:\n\n* Age: Esophageal cancer is more common in people over 60 years old\n* Smoking: Smoking is a significant risk factor for esophageal cancer\n* Alcohol consumption: Drinking alcohol, especially in large amounts, can increase the risk of esophageal cancer\n* Obesity: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of esophageal cancer\n* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): People with a history of GERD are at higher risk of developing esophageal cancer\n* Barrett's esophagus: A condition in which the lining of the esophagus changes, increasing the risk of esophageal cancer\n\n**Screening and Diagnosis**\n\nThere is no routine screening test for esophageal cancer, but people with a history of GERD or Barrett's esophagus may undergo upper endoscopy (EGD) to check for abnormal cell growth. If esophageal cancer is suspected, a doctor may perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for esophageal cancer depends on the stage and location of the cancer, as well as the overall health of the patient. Treatment options may include:\n\n* Surgery to remove the tumor and affected tissue\n* Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells\n* Radiation therapy to shrink the tumor\n* Targeted therapy to target specific cancer cells\n\nI hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with. \n\nNote: The passage you provided seems to be related to a study on screening for Barrett's esophagus, which is a precancerous condition that can increase the risk of esophageal cancer. If you have any specific questions about the passage or the study, I'd be happy to try to help.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nEsophageal cancer: Esophageal cancer is cancer that starts in the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope. Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include any of the following: - Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation) - Chest pain not related to eating - Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids - Heartburn - Vomiting blood - Weight loss Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include: - Barium swallow - Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease) - Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease) - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy - PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible) Stool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool. Upper endoscopy (EGD) will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery will be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using: - Open surgery, during which one or two larger incisions are made. - Minimally invasive surgery, during which a 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions. Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus. Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable. Beside a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include: - Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open. - A feeding tube into the stomach. - Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival. When the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Complications may include: - Pneumonia - Severe weight loss from not eating enough Call your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better. Also call if you have other symptoms of esophageal cancer. To reduce your risk of cancer of the esophagus: - DO NOT smoke - Limit or DO NOT drink alcoholic beverages - Get checked by your doctor if you have severe GERD - Get regular checkups if you have Barrett esophagus Updated by: Subodh K.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) can significantly affect an individual's quality of life, and when combined with weight loss, fainting, and difficulty digesting food, it's crucial to seek comprehensive medical care. Here's a step-by-step guide to help manage his condition:\n\n### 1. **Medical Consultation**\n- **Gastroenterologist**: The first step is to consult a gastroenterologist. A specialist can provide a detailed evaluation of his condition, ruling out other serious illnesses that might mimic IBS, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, or gastrointestinal infections.\n- **Diagnosis**: Ensure that the diagnosis of IBS is confirmed through thorough diagnostic tests, including stool tests, blood tests, and possibly endoscopy or colonoscopy to rule out other conditions.\n\n### 2. **Dietary Adjustments**\n- **Food Diary**: Keeping a food diary can help identify trigger foods that worsen symptoms. Common culprits include lactose, high FODMAP foods, spicy foods, and fatty foods.\n- **Low FODMAP Diet**: Consider consulting a dietitian about a low FODMAP diet. FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides, and Polyols) are types of carbohydrates that can be difficult for some people to digest, exacerbating IBS symptoms.\n- **Small, Frequent Meals**: Eating smaller, more frequent meals can help reduce symptoms of bloating and discomfort.\n\n### 3. **Management of Weight Loss and Weakness**\n- **Nutritional Supplements**: Due to malabsorption, your father might need supplements such as vitamins, minerals, and possibly protein shakes to ensure he's getting all the necessary nutrients.\n- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake is essential, especially if he's experiencing diarrhea, to prevent dehydration.\n\n### 4. **Preventing Fainting (Syncope)**\n- **Electrolyte Balance**: Ensure your father's electrolyte levels are balanced, as imbalances can lead to muscle weakness and fainting spells.\n- **Rest**: Encourage him to rest and avoid standing for long periods, especially in hot environments or after meals.\n\n### 5. **Medications and Treatment**\n- **Medication Review**: Consult with his healthcare provider about medications that might help manage IBS symptoms, such as antispasmodics for abdominal pain, laxatives for constipation, or antidiarrheal medications for diarrhea.\n- **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients find relief with alternative therapies like probiotics, acupuncture, or psychological therapies to manage stress, which can exacerbate IBS symptoms.\n\n### 6. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**\n- Regular follow-ups with his healthcare provider are crucial to monitor his condition, adjust treatments as needed, and address any new symptoms promptly.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- **Emergency Care**: If your father experiences severe symptoms such as persistent vomiting, bloody stools, severe abdominal pain, or frequent fainting, seek immediate medical attention.\n- **Mental Health Support**: Living with a chronic condition like IBS can be stressful and affect mental health. Consider seeking support from a mental health professional.\n\nBy taking a comprehensive approach to managing IBS, it's possible to alleviate symptoms, prevent weight loss and fainting, and improve your father's overall quality of life. Remember, every individual's experience with IBS is unique, so patience and close collaboration with healthcare professionals are key to finding the right management strategy.",

              "text": "Frozen shoulder: Frozen shoulder is a condition in which the shoulder is painful and loses motion because of inflammation. The capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint. Most of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Risk factors include: - Diabetes - Thyroid problems - Changes in your hormones, such as during menopause - Shoulder injury - Shoulder surgery - Open heart surgery - Cervical disk disease of the neck - Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected Main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are: - Decreased motion of the shoulder - Pain - Stiffness Frozen shoulder without any known cause starts with pain. This pain prevents you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you. Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made when you are not able to rotate your shoulder. You may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an MRI exam shows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder. Pain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion. It can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 6 to 9 months for complete recovery. Physical therapy is intense and needs to be done every day. Left untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little loss of motion. Risk factors for frozen shoulder, such as diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated. Surgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (shoulder arthroscopy) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy. Follow instructions on caring for your shoulder at home.\u00a0 Treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years. After surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you\u00a0do not\u00a0keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back. Complications may include: - Stiffness and pain continue even with therapy - The arm can break if the shoulder is moved forcefully during surgery If you have shoulder pain and stiffness and think you have a frozen shoulder, contact your provider for referral and treatment. Early treatment may help prevent stiffness. Call your provider if you develop shoulder pain that limits your range of motion for an extended period. People who have diabetes or thyroid problems will be less likely to get frozen shoulder if they keep their condition under control. Updated by: C.

The capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint. Most of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Risk factors include: - Diabetes - Thyroid problems - Changes in your hormones, such as during menopause - Shoulder injury - Shoulder surgery - Open heart surgery - Cervical disk disease of the neck - Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected Main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are: - Decreased motion of the shoulder - Pain - Stiffness Frozen shoulder without any known cause starts with pain. This pain prevents you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you. Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made when you are not able to rotate your shoulder. You may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an MRI exam shows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder. Pain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion. It can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 6 to 9 months for complete recovery. Physical therapy is intense and needs to be done every day. Left untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little loss of motion. Risk factors for frozen shoulder, such as diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated. Surgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (shoulder arthroscopy) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy. Follow instructions on caring for your shoulder at home.\u00a0 Treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year.

              "text": "Gastroparesis: Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis includegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetitegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomachpain in the stomach areaabdominal bloatinglack of appetiteSymptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine.

Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis.Ultrasound.Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed.Gastric emptying scintigraphy.SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract.SmartPill.Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Gastric emptying breath test. Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.MedicationsSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement.Metoclopramide (Reglan).Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.Erythromycin.Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.Other medications.Botulinum ToxinBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.11Gastric Electrical StimulationThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.JejunostomyIf medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe.Parenteral NutritionWhen gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen.To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need totake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessarytake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they taketake insulin after meals, instead of beforecheck blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessaryA health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis.In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. The problems of gastroparesis can includesevere dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptomssevere dehydration due to persistent vomitinggastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagusbezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill formdifficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetesmalnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intakedecreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition.

Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. What causes gastroparesis? Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetite Symptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. How is gastroparesis diagnosed? Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test.

What are the problems of gastroparesis? The problems of gastroparesis can include severe dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Points to Remember Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.

This can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Gastroparesis can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n* Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can damage the nerves that control stomach muscles, leading to gastroparesis.\n* Surgery: Certain surgeries, such as gastric bypass or fundoplication, can lead to gastroparesis.\n* Medications: Certain medications, such as opioids and anticholinergics, can slow down stomach emptying.\n* Infections: Viral or bacterial infections, such as gastroenteritis, can cause gastroparesis.\n* Neurological disorders: Conditions such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis can affect the nerves that control stomach muscles.\n\nTreatment for gastroparesis typically involves managing symptoms and addressing any underlying causes. This can include dietary changes, medication, and in some cases, surgery.\n\n**Feeding Tubes:**\n\nA feeding tube, also known as a gastrostomy tube, is a medical device that is inserted through the abdomen into the stomach to provide nutrition. There are different types of feeding tubes, including:\n\n* Gastrostomy tube (G-tube): A tube that is inserted directly into the stomach.\n* Jejunostomy tube (J-tube): A tube that is inserted into the small intestine (jejunum).\n* Gastrojejunostomy tube (GJ-tube): A tube that is inserted into both the stomach and small intestine.\n\nFeeding tubes are used to provide nutrition to individuals who are unable to eat or digest food normally. This can include people with gastroparesis, as well as those with other conditions such as esophageal cancer or cerebral palsy.\n\n**GJ Feeding Tube:**\n\nA GJ feeding tube, like the one you have, is a type of feeding tube that allows for nutrition to be delivered directly into the small intestine, bypassing the stomach. This can be beneficial for individuals with gastroparesis, as it allows for nutrition to be absorbed more efficiently.\n\n**Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN):**\n\nTPN is a type of nutrition that is delivered directly into the bloodstream through a vein. This is typically used for individuals who are unable to receive nutrition through the digestive system, such as those with severe gastrointestinal disorders or who are undergoing certain types of surgery.\n\nTPN typically includes a mixture of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, and is tailored to an individual's specific nutritional needs. While TPN can be lifesaving, it can also have complications, such as infection, blood clots, and liver damage.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nThe passage you provided discusses the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on gastrointestinal outcomes in patients undergoing surgery. The study found that patients who received GLP-1 receptor agonists in the 6 months preceding surgery had fewer gastrointestinal complications, including new gastroparesis diagnoses and gastrointestinal drug use. However, it's essential to note that this study was specific to patients with diabetes and may not be directly applicable to all individuals with gastroparesis.\n\nAs an advocate and support group admin, you play a vital role in helping individuals with gastroparesis navigate their condition and find resources and support.

Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis includegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetitegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomachpain in the stomach areaabdominal bloatinglack of appetiteSymptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.

Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Gastric emptying breath test. Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.MedicationsSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement.Metoclopramide (Reglan).Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.Erythromycin.Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.Other medications.Botulinum ToxinBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.11Gastric Electrical StimulationThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.JejunostomyIf medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe.Parenteral NutritionWhen gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen.To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need totake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessarytake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they taketake insulin after meals, instead of beforecheck blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessaryA health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis.In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. The problems of gastroparesis can includesevere dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptomssevere dehydration due to persistent vomitinggastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagusbezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill formdifficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetesmalnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intakedecreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests.

Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. What causes gastroparesis? Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetite Symptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. How is gastroparesis diagnosed? Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying. How is gastroparesis treated? Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying. A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met. When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given. Medications Several prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment. Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement. Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting. Botulinum Toxin Botulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.1 Gastric Electrical Stimulation This treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms. Jejunostomy If medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe. Parenteral Nutrition When gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. How is gastroparesis treated if a person has diabetes? An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control. The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen. To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need to take insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessary A health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis. In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. What are the problems of gastroparesis? The problems of gastroparesis can include severe dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Points to Remember Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally.

Given your pre-existing conditions, including diverticulosis, gastritis, and esophagitis, and your current symptoms of chest pain and difficulty speaking, it's essential to seek medical attention as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, I want to emphasize that chest pain can be a symptom of various conditions, some of which can be serious. While it's possible that your symptoms are related to your existing gastrointestinal issues, it's also important to consider other potential causes, such as cardiac problems.\n\nSince you're having trouble getting in to see your regular doctors, I recommend considering the following options:\n\n1. **Urgent Care Centers**: Visit an urgent care center in your area. These centers can provide immediate attention for non-life-threatening conditions and may have availability on short notice. They can evaluate your symptoms, perform basic tests, and provide guidance on what to do next.\n2. **Emergency Department**: If your symptoms worsen or you experience severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or other concerning symptoms, please go to the emergency department. Emergency departments are equipped to handle life-threatening conditions and can provide immediate attention.\n3. **Telemedicine**: If you have access to telemedicine services through your insurance or a healthcare provider, consider scheduling a virtual consultation. This can help you get some guidance from a healthcare professional while you wait for an in-person appointment.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips that may help alleviate your discomfort:\n\n* **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help soothe your esophagus and stomach.\n* **Avoid trigger foods**: If you know that certain foods exacerbate your gastritis or esophagitis, try to avoid them for now.\n* **Elevate your head**: When sleeping or resting, try to elevate your head using extra pillows to reduce stomach acid reflux.\n* **Over-the-counter pain relievers**: If your doctor has previously recommended over-the-counter pain relievers like antacids or acid reducers, you can try taking them as directed. However, always follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional before taking any new medications.\n\nRemember, these are temporary measures to help manage your symptoms. It's crucial to get a proper evaluation and guidance from a healthcare professional as soon as possible.\n\nPlease take care of yourself and try to get the medical attention you need. If your symptoms worsen or you experience severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or other concerning symptoms, don't hesitate to seek emergency help.",

              "text": "Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain. Most often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure. Watch this video about: Glaucoma Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma: - Open-angle glaucoma - Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma - Congenital glaucoma - Secondary glaucoma The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye. - In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow. - In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden. - Either type can damage the optic nerve. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. - The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it. - The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision. - Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. - Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack. - Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency. - If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your health care provider is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye. Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: - Drugs such as corticosteroids - Eye diseases such as uveitis (an infection of the middle layer of the eye) - Diseases such as diabetes - Eye injury Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies. - It often runs in families. - It is present at birth. - It is caused when the eye does not develop normally. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - Most people have no symptoms. - Once vision loss occurs, the damage is already severe. - Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision). - Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness. ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: - Sudden, severe pain in one eye - Decreased or cloudy vision, often called \"steamy\" vision - Nausea and vomiting - Rainbow-like halos around lights - Red eye - Eye feels swollen CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old. - Cloudiness of the front of the eye - Enlargement of one eye or both eyes - Red eye - Sensitivity to light - Tearing SECONDARY GLAUCOMA - Symptoms are most often related to the underlying problem causing the glaucoma. - Depending on the cause, symptoms may either be like open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. - You will be given a test to check your eye pressure. This is called tonometry. - In most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil. - When your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve. Eye pressure is different at different times of the day. Eye pressure can even be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include: - Using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy). - Photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of your eye (optic nerve imaging). - Checking your retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. - Checking how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response). - 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination). - Testing the clearness of your vision (visual acuity). - Testing your field of vision (visual field measurement). The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops. - You may need more than one type. Most people can be treated with eye drops. - Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past. - You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye. If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment: - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out. - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure. - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack. - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack. CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery. - This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain. SECONDARY GLAUCOMA If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions. Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision. Babies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early. How you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition. If you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma. You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. But you can help prevent vision loss. - A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. - All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. - If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40. - You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss. Updated by: Franklin W.

However, please note that it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized information and advice.\n\n**What is Glaucoma?**\n\nGlaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is vital for good vision. The optic nerve carries visual information from the eye to the brain, and if it's damaged, it can lead to vision loss and even blindness. Glaucoma is often referred to as the \"silent thief of sight\" because it can cause permanent damage before symptoms become apparent.\n\n**Types of Glaucoma**\n\nThere are several types of glaucoma, including:\n\n1. **Open-Angle Glaucoma**: This is the most common type of glaucoma, where the drainage channels in the eye become clogged, causing pressure to build up.\n2. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma occurs when the drainage channels in the eye are suddenly blocked, causing a rapid increase in pressure.\n3. **Normal-Tension Glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma occurs when the optic nerve is damaged despite normal eye pressure.\n4. **Congenital Glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma occurs in infants and young children, and is often caused by an abnormality in the eye's drainage system.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nGlaucoma can be caused by a combination of factors, including:\n\n1. **High Eye Pressure**: Elevated eye pressure is the most significant risk factor for glaucoma.\n2. **Age**: Glaucoma is more common in people over 60 years old.\n3. **Family History**: Having a family history of glaucoma increases your risk.\n4. **Diabetes**: People with diabetes are at higher risk of developing glaucoma.\n5. **Trauma**: Eye injuries can increase the risk of developing glaucoma.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn the early stages of glaucoma, there are often no symptoms. However, as the condition progresses, you may experience:\n\n1. **Blurred Vision**: Vision may become blurry or distorted.\n2. **Loss of Peripheral Vision**: You may start to lose your peripheral vision, making it difficult to see things out of the corner of your eye.\n3. **Eye Pain**: You may experience eye pain, especially if you have angle-closure glaucoma.\n4. **Nausea and Vomiting**: Some people may experience nausea and vomiting due to eye pain.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for glaucoma depends on the type and severity of the condition. Common treatments include:\n\n1. **Eye Drops**: Medications in the form of eye drops can help reduce eye pressure.\n2. **Oral Medications**: Oral medications can also help reduce eye pressure.\n3. **Laser Surgery**: Laser surgery can help improve drainage in the eye.\n4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to improve drainage or remove blockages.\n\n**Living with Glaucoma**\n\nWhile there is no cure for glaucoma, with proper treatment, you can manage the condition and prevent further vision loss. Here are some tips:\n\n1. **Take Your Medication**: Take your medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider.\n2. **Attend Regular Check-Ups**: Regular check-ups with your eye doctor can help monitor your condition and adjust treatment as needed.\n3. **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle**: Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking can help reduce your risk of developing other eye conditions.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Remember to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment.

However, please note that it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized information and advice.\n\n**What is Glaucoma?**\n\nGlaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is vital for good vision. The optic nerve carries visual information from the eye to the brain, and if it's damaged, it can lead to vision loss and even blindness. Glaucoma is often referred to as the \"silent thief of sight\" because it can cause permanent damage before symptoms become apparent.\n\n**Types of Glaucoma**\n\nThere are several types of glaucoma, including:\n\n1. **Open-Angle Glaucoma**: This is the most common type of glaucoma, where the drainage channels in the eye become clogged, causing pressure to build up.\n2. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma occurs when the drainage channels in the eye are suddenly blocked, causing a rapid increase in pressure.\n3. **Normal-Tension Glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma occurs when the optic nerve is damaged despite normal eye pressure.\n4. **Congenital Glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma occurs in infants and young children, and is often caused by an abnormality in the eye's drainage system.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nGlaucoma can be caused by a combination of factors, including:\n\n1. **High Eye Pressure**: Elevated eye pressure is the most significant risk factor for glaucoma.\n2. **Age**: Glaucoma is more common in people over 60 years old.\n3. **Family History**: Having a family history of glaucoma increases your risk.\n4. **Diabetes**: People with diabetes are at higher risk of developing glaucoma.\n5. **Trauma**: Eye injuries can increase the risk of developing glaucoma.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn the early stages of glaucoma, there are often no symptoms. However, as the condition progresses, you may experience:\n\n1. **Blurred Vision**: Vision may become blurry or distorted.\n2. **Loss of Peripheral Vision**: You may start to lose your peripheral vision, making it difficult to see things out of the corner of your eye.\n3. **Eye Pain**: You may experience eye pain, especially if you have angle-closure glaucoma.\n4. **Nausea and Vomiting**: Some people may experience nausea and vomiting due to eye pain.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for glaucoma depends on the type and severity of the condition. Common treatments include:\n\n1. **Eye Drops**: Medications in the form of eye drops can help reduce eye pressure.\n2. **Oral Medications**: Oral medications can also help reduce eye pressure.\n3. **Laser Surgery**: Laser surgery can help improve drainage in the eye.\n4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to improve drainage or remove blockages.\n\n**Living with Glaucoma**\n\nWhile there is no cure for glaucoma, with proper treatment, you can manage the condition and prevent further vision loss. Here are some tips:\n\n1. **Take Your Medication**: Take your medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider.\n2. **Attend Regular Check-Ups**: Regular check-ups with your eye doctor can help monitor your condition and adjust treatment as needed.\n3. **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle**: Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking can help reduce your risk of developing other eye conditions.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Remember to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment. They can help you develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs.\n\nAdditionally, here are some reputable resources where you can find more information about glaucoma:\n\n1. **American Academy of Ophthalmology** (AAO): [www.aao.org](http://www.aao.org)\n2. **National Eye Institute** (NEI): [www.nei.nih.gov](http://www.nei.nih.gov)\n3. **Glaucoma Research Foundation**: [www.glaucoma.org](http://www.glaucoma.org)\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific questions or concerns, and I'll do my best to address them.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nGlaucoma: Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain. Most often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure. Watch this video about: Glaucoma Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma: - Open-angle glaucoma - Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma - Congenital glaucoma - Secondary glaucoma The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye. - In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow. - In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden. - Either type can damage the optic nerve. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. - The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it. - The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision. - Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. - Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack. - Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency. - If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your health care provider is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye. Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: - Drugs such as corticosteroids - Eye diseases such as uveitis (an infection of the middle layer of the eye) - Diseases such as diabetes - Eye injury Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies. - It often runs in families. - It is present at birth. - It is caused when the eye does not develop normally. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - Most people have no symptoms. - Once vision loss occurs, the damage is already severe. - Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision). - Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness. ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: - Sudden, severe pain in one eye - Decreased or cloudy vision, often called \"steamy\" vision - Nausea and vomiting - Rainbow-like halos around lights - Red eye - Eye feels swollen CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old. - Cloudiness of the front of the eye - Enlargement of one eye or both eyes - Red eye - Sensitivity to light - Tearing SECONDARY GLAUCOMA - Symptoms are most often related to the underlying problem causing the glaucoma. - Depending on the cause, symptoms may either be like open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. - You will be given a test to check your eye pressure. This is called tonometry. - In most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil. - When your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve. Eye pressure is different at different times of the day. Eye pressure can even be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include: - Using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy). - Photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of your eye (optic nerve imaging). - Checking your retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. - Checking how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response). - 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination). - Testing the clearness of your vision (visual acuity). - Testing your field of vision (visual field measurement). The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops. - You may need more than one type. Most people can be treated with eye drops. - Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past. - You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye. If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment: - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out. - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure. - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack. - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack. CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery. - This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain. SECONDARY GLAUCOMA If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions. Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision. Babies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early. How you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition. If you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma. You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. But you can help prevent vision loss. - A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. - All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. - If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40. - You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss. Updated by: Franklin W.

              "text": "Hair loss (Treatment): Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year. Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results. The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss. Medication If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months. Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are: - Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits. Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). - Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits. Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets. Surgery In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left. During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results. Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring. Wigs and hairpieces You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available. If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor."

            "text": "Losing one's hair can be distressing, especially when it affects self-image or makes one feel like a villainous character, such as Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers series, minus the hair. Hair loss, or alopecia, can be caused by a variety of factors including genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, medications, stress, and age. To address hair loss and potentially promote hair growth, consider the following steps and treatments:\n\n### 1. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**\nBefore starting any new treatments, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider or a dermatologist who specializes in hair loss. They can help determine the underlying cause of your hair loss, which is vital for selecting the most effective treatment.\n\n### 2. **Medications**\n- **Minoxidil (Rogaine):** This is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you apply to your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further loss.\n- **Finasteride (Propecia):** This is a prescription drug that you take daily. It's primarily used for male pattern baldness and works by slowing down hair loss and stimulating new hair growth.\n\n### 3. **Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)**\nLLLT uses a low-level laser or light-emitting device, which can be applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth. Devices are available for both clinical and home use.\n\n### 4. **Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy**\nPRP involves drawing a person's blood, processing it to have a high concentration of platelets, and then injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.\n\n### 5. **Hair Transplantation**\nFor more severe cases of hair loss, hair transplantation can be an effective option. This surgical procedure involves moving hair follicles from the back and side of the scalp to the balding areas.\n\n### 6. **Dietary Changes**\nEating a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly those that promote hair growth such as:\n- **Iron:** Found in red meat, spinach, and lentils.\n- **Zinc:** Found in oysters, beef, and chicken.\n- **Biotin:** Found in eggs, nuts, and whole grains.\n- **Vitamin C:** Found in citrus fruits, strawberries, and bell peppers.\n- **Omega-3 fatty acids:** Found in salmon, walnuts, and chia seeds.\n\n### 7. **Reduce Stress**\nHigh stress levels can contribute to hair loss. Engaging in stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises can help.\n\n### 8. **Gentle Hair Care**\n- Avoid harsh chemicals and heat styling tools.\n- Use gentle shampoo and conditioner suitable for your hair type.\n- Reduce the frequency of washing your hair to prevent stripping it of natural oils.\n\nRemember, it's essential to have realistic expectations. Hair growth is a slow process, and it may take several months to a year or more to notice significant results from any treatment. Also, not all hair loss can be fully reversed, but with the right approach, you can potentially stimulate hair growth and reduce further loss. If you're looking to regain your mojo, or in your case, resemble less the bald version of Dr. Evil, starting with professional advice and trying a combination of these methods may be your best bet.",

It's primarily used for male pattern baldness and works by slowing down hair loss and stimulating new hair growth.\n\n### 3. **Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)**\nLLLT uses a low-level laser or light-emitting device, which can be applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth. Devices are available for both clinical and home use.\n\n### 4. **Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy**\nPRP involves drawing a person's blood, processing it to have a high concentration of platelets, and then injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.\n\n### 5. **Hair Transplantation**\nFor more severe cases of hair loss, hair transplantation can be an effective option. This surgical procedure involves moving hair follicles from the back and side of the scalp to the balding areas.\n\n### 6. **Dietary Changes**\nEating a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly those that promote hair growth such as:\n- **Iron:** Found in red meat, spinach, and lentils.\n- **Zinc:** Found in oysters, beef, and chicken.\n- **Biotin:** Found in eggs, nuts, and whole grains.\n- **Vitamin C:** Found in citrus fruits, strawberries, and bell peppers.\n- **Omega-3 fatty acids:** Found in salmon, walnuts, and chia seeds.\n\n### 7. **Reduce Stress**\nHigh stress levels can contribute to hair loss. Engaging in stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises can help.\n\n### 8. **Gentle Hair Care**\n- Avoid harsh chemicals and heat styling tools.\n- Use gentle shampoo and conditioner suitable for your hair type.\n- Reduce the frequency of washing your hair to prevent stripping it of natural oils.\n\nRemember, it's essential to have realistic expectations. Hair growth is a slow process, and it may take several months to a year or more to notice significant results from any treatment. Also, not all hair loss can be fully reversed, but with the right approach, you can potentially stimulate hair growth and reduce further loss. If you're looking to regain your mojo, or in your case, resemble less the bald version of Dr. Evil, starting with professional advice and trying a combination of these methods may be your best bet.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHair loss (Treatment): Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year. Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results. The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss. Medication If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months. Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are: - Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits. Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). - Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits. Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets. Surgery In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left. During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results. Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring. Wigs and hairpieces You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available. If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Back braces can be adjusted as you grow. Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis. You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly. Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible: - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs. - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together. - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still. Scoliosis treatment may also include: - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace. - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly."

              "text": "Overweight and Obesity (Treatment): Treatment for overweight and obesity depends on the cause and severity of your condition. Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. You may need treatments for any complications that you have. Healthy lifestyle changes To help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend that you adopt lifelong healthy lifestyle changes. Heart-healthy eating. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It\u2019s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Use the Body Weight Planner to find out your daily calorie needs and to set goals. Visit healthy recipes and plan for success. Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. Visit Chose My Plate or 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for more information. Physical activity. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Physical activity is an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Visit Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits for more information. Healthy Sleep. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Read Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency more information. Making lifelong healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and physical activity, can help you modify your energy balance to help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight. For example: To aim for a healthy weight, or lose weight, you want your energy OUT to be more than your energy IN. To maintain weight loss you want your energy IN and energy OUT to be the same.\u00a0 Behavioral weight-loss programs Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. Read Living With\u00a0for more information about required follow-up for these behavioral treatment programs. Read more Did you know your brain\u2019s pleasure and reward centers can be stimulated by food and the act of eating, making it harder to change eating patterns and lose weight? Researchers know that our brains can become patterned so that we feel pleasure or reward from eating. This can make us unconsciously crave food so our bodies feel that sense of pleasure. It can also make it hard to change our eating patterns, lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers are studying whether cognitive behavioral therapies can be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity by retraining the brain to not associate pleasure with food and the act of eating. Medicines When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. These medicines work in the following parts of your body. Brain. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Weight loss medicines are not recommended as a single treatment for weight loss. These medicines can help you lose weight but when combined with lifestyle changes may result in greater weight loss. Some of these medicines should not be used if you have certain conditions or are taking certain medicines. Also, these medicines have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breast feeding, or have a family history of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke. Surgical procedures Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. A small part of the stomach is connected to the middle part of the intestine, bypassing the first part of intestine. This decreases the amount of food that you can eat and the amount of fat your body can take in and store. Gastrectomy. A big portion of the stomach is removed to decrease the amount of food that you can eat. Gastric banding. A hollow band is placed around the upper part of the stomach creating a smaller stomach. This decreases the amount of food you can eat. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, internal rupture of sutures, or even death. Read gastric bypass surgery for more information. Read more Interested in learning why these surgeries lead to weight loss in some patients? First, these surgeries reduce the amount of food stored in the stomach and the amount of calories your body can take in. This can help your body restore energy balance. Second, these surgeries change the levels of certain hormones and the way the brain responds to these hormones to control hunger urges. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery. Look for Living With\u00a0will explain recommendations that your doctor may give, including lifelong healthy lifestyle changes and medical care to prevent your condition from recurring, getting worse, or causing complications. Research for Your Health\u00a0will explain how we are using current research and advancing research to treat people with overweight and obesity.

I'd be happy to provide you with more information on HIV/AIDS treatment, especially in the context of your study focusing on HIV-positive transgender women.\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system fight off infections. If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), which is the most severe phase of HIV infection.\n\n**HIV/AIDS Treatment:**\n\nThe primary goal of HIV treatment is to suppress the virus, which helps to:\n\n1. **Maintain a healthy immune system**: By keeping the virus at bay, the body's immune system can continue to fight off infections and diseases.\n2. **Prevent transmission**: Effective treatment can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others.\n3. **Improve overall health and quality of life**: HIV treatment can help individuals with HIV live longer, healthier lives.\n\nThe standard treatment for HIV is **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**, which typically involves a combination of medications that:\n\n1. **Suppress the virus**: Reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) to undetectable levels.\n2. **Prevent drug resistance**: Using multiple medications helps to prevent the development of drug-resistant HIV strains.\n\n**HIV Treatment for Transgender Women:**\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge that transgender women, particularly those living with HIV, face unique challenges and barriers to accessing quality care. Your study is crucial in addressing these disparities.\n\nSome key considerations for HIV treatment in transgender women include:\n\n1. **Hormone therapy**: For transgender women who are taking hormone therapy, it's essential to ensure that their HIV treatment regimen is compatible with their hormone regimen.\n2. **Mental health support**: Transgender women may experience higher rates of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, which can impact their HIV treatment adherence.\n3. **Social and economic support**: Providing access to social and economic support services, such as housing, food, and employment assistance, can help improve HIV treatment outcomes.\n4. **Culturally competent care**: Healthcare providers should be trained to provide culturally competent care that respects the individual's gender identity and addresses their unique needs.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\nFor more information on HIV/AIDS treatment and resources for transgender women, you can visit the following websites:\n\n1. **CDC** (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention): [www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov)\n2. **WHO** (World Health Organization): [www.who.int](http://www.who.int)\n3. **The Global Fund**: [www.theglobalfund.org](http://www.theglobalfund.org)\n4. **Local HIV/AIDS organizations**: Look for organizations in your area that provide HIV/AIDS services, support, and resources specifically for transgender women.\n\nI hope this information is helpful for your study and the individuals you're working with.

Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart. By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position). Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as: - Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed) - Osteomyelitis (bone infection) - Overweight or obesity - Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D) A health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development. Knock knees are not treated in most cases. If the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace. This brace is attached to a shoe. Surgery may be considered for knock knees that are severe and continue beyond late childhood. Children normally outgrow knock knees without treatment, unless it is caused by a disease. If surgery is needed, the results are most often good. Complications may include: - Difficulty walking (very rare) - Self-esteem changes related to cosmetic appearance of knock knees - If left untreated, knock knees can lead to early arthritis of the knee Call your provider if you think your child has knock knees. There is no known prevention for normal knock knees. Updated by: Neil K. Kaneshiro, MD, MHA, Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

This condition can be present from birth or develop during childhood, and it's more common in children under the age of 7. However, in some cases, it can persist into adulthood, like in your situation.\n\n**Causes of knock knees:**\nThe causes of knock knees can vary, but some common factors include:\n\n1. Genetics: Family history can play a role in developing knock knees.\n2. Poor alignment of the legs: This can cause the knees to angle inward, leading to knock knees.\n3. Overweight or obesity: Excess weight can put additional stress on the knee joint, worsening the condition.\n4. Weak leg muscles: Weakness in the leg muscles can contribute to poor alignment and knock knees.\n\n**Treatment options for knock knees:**\nThe treatment for knock knees depends on the severity of the condition and the underlying cause. Here are some possible treatment options:\n\n1. **Observation:** If your knock knees are mild, your doctor may recommend observation to monitor the condition and ensure it doesn't worsen.\n2. **Physical therapy:** A physical therapist can help you strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your overall leg alignment.\n3. **Orthotics and shoe inserts:** Custom-made shoe inserts or orthotics can help redistribute the weight and pressure on your knee joint, reducing discomfort and improving alignment.\n4. **Bracing:** In some cases, a knee brace can help stabilize the knee and improve alignment.\n5. **Surgery:** If your knock knees are severe or causing significant discomfort, surgical intervention may be necessary.

              "text": "Nose fracture: A nose fracture is a break in the bone or cartilage over the bridge, or in the sidewall or septum (structure that divides the nostrils) of the nose. A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face. Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck. Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse. For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms may include: - Blood coming from the nose - Bruising around the eyes - Difficulty breathing through the nose - Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down) - Pain - Swelling The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. If a nose injury happens: - Try to stay calm. - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat. - Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding. - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose. - To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). - DO NOT try to straighten a broken nose - DO NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury Get medical help right away if: - Bleeding will not stop - Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose - You suspect a blood clot in the septum - You suspect a neck or head injury - The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape - The person is having difficulty breathing Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, or\u00a0riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades.

            "text": "I'm sorry to hear that you've been dealing with a fractured nose for 3 years. Fixing a fractured nose, especially one that has been broken for an extended period, is a bit more complex than treating a fresh break. The process involves a procedure known as a septorhinoplasty, which can address both functional issues (like breathing difficulties) and cosmetic concerns (like the appearance of the nose).\n\nHere's a general overview of what you might expect:\n\n1. **Consultation with a Specialist**: The first step is to consult with an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist or a plastic surgeon who has experience in rhinoplasty. They will examine your nose, discuss your goals, and explain the possibilities and limitations of the surgery.\n\n2. **Evaluation**: The specialist will likely perform a thorough examination, which may include nasal endoscopy to evaluate the internal structures of your nose, and possibly CT scans to assess the extent of the fracture and any secondary changes that might have occurred over the years.\n\n3. **Surgical Planning**: Based on the evaluation, the surgeon will plan the surgery. The goals of the surgery are to restore the normal function of the nose (e.g., improving breathing) and to improve its appearance. Since your nose has been broken for 3 years, the surgery might involve restructuring the nasal septum, realigning the nasal bones, and possibly using grafts (from your own body or synthetic) to support the nose or improve its shape.\n\n4. **Surgery**: The surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon may use an open or closed approach, depending on the complexity of the procedure. In an open approach, a small incision is made on the columella (the skin between the nostrils), while a closed approach involves incisions inside the nostrils. The choice of approach depends on the extent of the reconstruction needed.\n\n5. **Recovery**: After the surgery, you can expect some swelling, bruising, and possibly nasal congestion. Your surgeon will provide guidance on pain management, wound care, and follow-up appointments. It's crucial to follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth recovery. The swelling will gradually subside over several weeks to months, and it may take up to a year or more for the nose to settle into its final shape.\n\n6. **Follow-Up**: Post-operative follow-ups with your surgeon are important to monitor the healing process, remove any sutures or splints, and address any concerns you might have.\n\nIt's essential to note that insurance coverage for this procedure can vary depending on whether the surgery is deemed medically necessary (for functional reasons, like breathing problems) or cosmetic (for appearance alone). Pre-approval from your insurance provider may be necessary.\n\nGiven the complexity and the individual variables involved in such a procedure, consulting with a specialist will provide you with the most accurate and personalized advice for your situation.",

A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face. Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck. Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse. For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms may include: - Blood coming from the nose - Bruising around the eyes - Difficulty breathing through the nose - Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down) - Pain - Swelling The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. If a nose injury happens: - Try to stay calm. - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat. - Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding. - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose. - To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). - DO NOT try to straighten a broken nose - DO NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury Get medical help right away if: - Bleeding will not stop - Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose - You suspect a blood clot in the septum - You suspect a neck or head injury - The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape - The person is having difficulty breathing Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, or\u00a0riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades. Use seat belts and appropriate car seats when driving. Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

              "text": "Anal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor."

            "text": "I'm so sorry to hear that you've been dealing with an anal fissure for close to two years. That must be incredibly frustrating and painful for you. An anal fissure is a small tear in the lining of the anus, which can cause severe pain, bleeding, and discomfort during and after bowel movements.\n\nGiven that your fissure has not healed despite two years of trying, it's essential to revisit your treatment plan and consider some adjustments. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Re-evaluate your diet**: A high-fiber diet can help soften your stool, making it easier to pass and reducing the strain on your anus. Include foods rich in fiber like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes in your diet. Also, ensure you're drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated.\n2. **Topical treatments**: Apply topical creams or ointments that can help increase blood flow to the area, promote healing, and reduce pain. Some common over-the-counter (OTC) options include:\n\t* Nitroglycerin ointment (0.4%): applies a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times a day.\n\t* Diltiazem cream or ointment (2%): applies a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times a day.\n\t* Lidocaine ointment (5%): applies a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times a day.\n3. **Sitz baths**: Soak in warm water for 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times a day, to help relax the anal sphincter and increase blood flow to the area. You can add a tablespoon of baking soda or Epsom salt to the water for extra relief.\n4. **Avoid straining**: Try to avoid straining during bowel movements, as this can exacerbate the fissure. Take your time, and consider using a stool softener or laxative if you need to.\n5. **Consider medical procedures**: If your fissure is severe or hasn't responded to conservative treatments, you may want to discuss the following options with your doctor:\n\t* **Lateral internal sphincterotomy**: a minor surgical procedure that involves making a small cut in the internal anal sphincter to reduce spasm and promote healing.\n\t* **Fissurectomy**: a surgical procedure that involves removing the fissure and any scar tissue.\n6. **Consult a specialist**: If you haven't already, consider consulting a gastroenterologist or a colorectal surgeon who can assess your condition and provide personalized guidance.\n7. **Keep the area clean**: Gently clean the area with mild soap and water after each bowel movement to prevent infection.\n8. **Manage pain**: Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage pain and discomfort.\n9. **Consider biofeedback therapy**: This type of therapy can help you become more aware of your body's internal sensations and learn to relax your anal sphincter, which can help promote healing.\n10. **Be patient**: Healing an anal fissure can take time, so it's essential to be patient and persistent with your treatment plan.\n\nRemember to consult your doctor before starting any new treatments or making significant changes to your current regimen. They can help you determine the best course of action and ensure that you're receiving the proper care for your condition.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find some relief and healing from your anal fissure. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",

Please what do you suggest i do? Thanks\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nI'm so sorry to hear that you've been dealing with an anal fissure for close to two years. That must be incredibly frustrating and painful for you. An anal fissure is a small tear in the lining of the anus, which can cause severe pain, bleeding, and discomfort during and after bowel movements.\n\nGiven that your fissure has not healed despite two years of trying, it's essential to revisit your treatment plan and consider some adjustments. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Re-evaluate your diet**: A high-fiber diet can help soften your stool, making it easier to pass and reducing the strain on your anus. Include foods rich in fiber like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes in your diet. Also, ensure you're drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated.\n2. **Topical treatments**: Apply topical creams or ointments that can help increase blood flow to the area, promote healing, and reduce pain. Some common over-the-counter (OTC) options include:\n\t* Nitroglycerin ointment (0.4%): applies a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times a day.\n\t* Diltiazem cream or ointment (2%): applies a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times a day.\n\t* Lidocaine ointment (5%): applies a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times a day.\n3. **Sitz baths**: Soak in warm water for 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times a day, to help relax the anal sphincter and increase blood flow to the area.

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nAnal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Don't try to treat an ingrown nail at home. Otherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home: - Soak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry. - Gently massage over the inflamed skin. - Place a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton or floss with water or antiseptic. When trimming your toenails: - Briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. - Use a clean, sharp trimmer. - Trim toenails straight across the top. Do not taper or round the corners or trim too short.\u00a0 - Do not try to cut out the ingrown portion of the nail yourself. This will only make the problem worse. Consider wearing sandals until the problem goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it does not treat the problem. If this doesn't work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your family doctor, a foot specialist (podiatrist), or a skin specialist (dermatologist). If the ingrown nail doesn't heal or keeps coming back, your provider may remove part of the nail: - Numbing medicine is first injected into the toe. - The ingrown part of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion. - It takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow. If the toe is infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. After the procedure, follow any instructions for helping your nail heal."

This can help prevent the nail from growing into the skin.\n4. **Wear comfortable shoes**: Avoid tight shoes that put pressure on your toes.\n5. **Apply topical treatments**: Over-the-counter creams or ointments containing ingredients like antibiotics, steroids, or tea tree oil may help reduce inflammation and prevent infection.\n\n**Medical treatment options:**\n\n1. **Antibiotics**: If your ingrown toenail becomes infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to clear up the infection.\n2. **Partial nail avulsion**: In this procedure, your doctor will remove the portion of the nail that's growing into the skin.\n3. **Nail bracing**: A special device is applied to the nail to help lift it away from the skin and promote proper growth.\n4. **Surgical removal**: In severe cases, your doctor may recommend surgically removing the entire nail or a portion of it.\n\n**Home remedies:**\n\n1. **Epsom salt soak**: Soaking your foot in a solution of warm water and Epsom salt may help reduce inflammation and pain.\n2. **Apple cider vinegar soak**: Soaking your foot in a solution of warm water and apple cider vinegar may help balance the pH of your skin and reduce inflammation.\n3. **Tea tree oil**: Applying tea tree oil to the affected area may help prevent infection and promote healing.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment. They can assess the severity of your ingrown toenail and recommend the best course of treatment.\n\nPlease make an appointment with a doctor or a podiatrist as soon as possible to get the help you need. In the meantime, try some of the self-care tips and home remedies I mentioned to help manage your symptoms.\n\nFeel better soon!\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nIngrown toenail (Treatment): If you have diabetes, nerve problem in the leg or foot, poor blood circulation to your foot, or an infection around the nail, see a provider right away. Don't try to treat an ingrown nail at home. Otherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home: - Soak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry. - Gently massage over the inflamed skin. - Place a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton or floss with water or antiseptic. When trimming your toenails: - Briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. - Use a clean, sharp trimmer. - Trim toenails straight across the top. Do not taper or round the corners or trim too short.\u00a0 - Do not try to cut out the ingrown portion of the nail yourself. This will only make the problem worse. Consider wearing sandals until the problem goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it does not treat the problem. If this doesn't work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your family doctor, a foot specialist (podiatrist), or a skin specialist (dermatologist). If the ingrown nail doesn't heal or keeps coming back, your provider may remove part of the nail: - Numbing medicine is first injected into the toe. - The ingrown part of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion. - It takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow. If the toe is infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. After the procedure, follow any instructions for helping your nail heal.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis (Description): SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells."

The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to\u00a0result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (\"Lewy bodies\") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however,\u00a0medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms. [1] [2] [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delusions - Dementia - Fluctuations in consciousness - Parkinsonism - Visual hallucinations - The exact underlying cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood. The symptoms of the condition are thought to occur when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the regions of the brain involved in thinking, memory and movement. The build-up of these clumps (which are called \"Lewy bodies\") appears to be associated with a loss of certain neurons (nerve cells ) in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters (chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells). The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, sleep, and mood. [4] Although Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically, more than one family member can rarely be affected. Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. For example, copy number variants or changes ( mutations ) in the SNCA gene have been reported in a few affected families. [5] [6] The APOE \u03b54 allele and mutations in the GBA gene have been associated with an increased risk of Lewy body dementia and the APOE \u03b52 allele with a decreased risk. [5] [7] [2] Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited . The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. [4] Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases\u00a0do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). [6] [5] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person\u2019s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.

Is Lewy Body Disease hereditary?**\n\nLewy Body Disease, also known as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. While there is no straightforward answer to whether LBD is hereditary, research suggests that genetics may play a role in some cases. However, the majority of LBD cases are considered sporadic, meaning they occur without a clear family history.\n\nStudies have identified several genetic variants that may increase the risk of developing LBD, but these variants are not sufficient to cause the disease on their own. Additionally, having a family history of LBD or other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease, may increase a person's risk of developing LBD. Nevertheless, many people with LBD do not have a family history of the disease, and many people with a family history of LBD do not develop the disease themselves.\n\n**2. Does alcoholism play a role in the beginning process of Lewy Body Disease?**\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence to suggest that alcoholism plays a direct role in the beginning process of Lewy Body Disease. However, chronic alcohol abuse can lead to a range of cognitive and neurological problems, including dementia, which may be misdiagnosed as LBD.\n\nAlcoholism can also increase the risk of developing other health problems, such as dehydration, malnutrition, and head injuries, which may exacerbate or contribute to the development of cognitive decline.

People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to\u00a0result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (\"Lewy bodies\") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however,\u00a0medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms. [1] [2] [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delusions - Dementia - Fluctuations in consciousness - Parkinsonism - Visual hallucinations - The exact underlying cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood. The symptoms of the condition are thought to occur when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the regions of the brain involved in thinking, memory and movement. The build-up of these clumps (which are called \"Lewy bodies\") appears to be associated with a loss of certain neurons (nerve cells ) in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters (chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells). The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, sleep, and mood. [4] Although Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically, more than one family member can rarely be affected. Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. For example, copy number variants or changes ( mutations ) in the SNCA gene have been reported in a few affected families. [5] [6] The APOE \u03b54 allele and mutations in the GBA gene have been associated with an increased risk of Lewy body dementia and the APOE \u03b52 allele with a decreased risk. [5] [7] [2] Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited . The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. [4] Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases\u00a0do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). [6] [5] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person\u2019s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. The Lewy Body Dementia Association offers detailed and up-to-date information regarding the treatment and management of Lewy body dementia .

Persons with Tay-Sachs also have \"cherry-red\" spots in their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0A much rarer form of the disorder, called late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration. The incidence of Tay-Sachs has been particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent., as well as in certain French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns. Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease. Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired. \u00a0A very severe form of Tay-Sachs disease is know as Sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube. Even with the best of care, children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4, from recurring infection."

What is TSD/Clubfoot, and how does it affect a baby?**\n\nTay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which leads to the accumulation of toxic substances in the brain and spinal cord. Babies with TSD appear normal at birth, but as the disease progresses, they may experience symptoms such as:\n* Muscle weakness and wasting\n* Seizures\n* Vision and hearing loss\n* Paralysis\n* Mental retardation\n\nClubfoot, also known as talipes equinovarus, is a congenital condition where a baby's foot is twisted inward or outward, making it difficult to walk or stand. It is usually noticeable at birth and can be treated with various methods, including casting, bracing, or surgery.\n\n**2. What causes both conditions, can it be prevented, treated, or cured?**\n\nTay-Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation that is inherited from both parents, who are usually carriers of the disease. It is more common in certain ethnic groups, such as Ashkenazi Jews. While there is no cure for TSD, early detection and treatment can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression. Genetic counseling and screening can help identify carriers and prevent the transmission of the disease to their offspring.\n\nClubfoot is also a congenital condition, and its exact cause is still unknown. However, it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as:\n* Family history\n* Intrauterine position\n* Muscular or nerve abnormalities\n* Environmental factors, such as exposure to certain toxins or viruses during pregnancy\n\nClubfoot can be treated with a variety of methods, including:\n* Casting: to gradually correct the foot's position\n* Bracing: to maintain the corrected position\n* Surgery: to release tight tendons and correct the foot's position\n* Physical therapy: to strengthen the foot and ankle muscles\n\n**3. How common is TSD? How common is Clubfoot?**\n\nTay-Sachs disease is a rare condition, affecting about 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 30,000 births in the general population. However, it is more common in certain ethnic groups, such as Ashkenazi Jews, where it affects about 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 3,000 births.\n\nClubfoot is a relatively common congenital condition, affecting about 1 in 1,000 births. It is more common in boys than girls, and it can occur in one or both feet.\n\n**4. How can your \"agency\" help a woman/couple who are concerned about this congenital condition, and is there a cost?**\n\nAs a hypothetical agency, we can provide the following services to support women and couples concerned about Tay-Sachs disease and clubfoot:\n* Genetic counseling: to discuss the risks and probabilities of inherited conditions\n* Carrier screening: to identify carriers of TSD and other genetic disorders\n* Prenatal testing: to detect potential congenital conditions during pregnancy\n* Referrals to specialists: for further evaluation and treatment of clubfoot or other conditions\n* Emotional support: to provide guidance and reassurance throughout the reproductive journey\n\nThe cost of these services may vary depending on the location, insurance coverage, and specific tests or procedures required. However, many healthcare providers and agencies offer free or low-cost genetic counseling and screening services, especially for high-risk populations.\n\nI hope this information has been helpful in addressing your concerns about Tay-Sachs disease and clubfoot.

What is TSD/Clubfoot, and how does it affect a baby?**\n\nTay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which leads to the accumulation of toxic substances in the brain and spinal cord. Babies with TSD appear normal at birth, but as the disease progresses, they may experience symptoms such as:\n* Muscle weakness and wasting\n* Seizures\n* Vision and hearing loss\n* Paralysis\n* Mental retardation\n\nClubfoot, also known as talipes equinovarus, is a congenital condition where a baby's foot is twisted inward or outward, making it difficult to walk or stand. It is usually noticeable at birth and can be treated with various methods, including casting, bracing, or surgery.\n\n**2. What causes both conditions, can it be prevented, treated, or cured?**\n\nTay-Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation that is inherited from both parents, who are usually carriers of the disease. It is more common in certain ethnic groups, such as Ashkenazi Jews. While there is no cure for TSD, early detection and treatment can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression. Genetic counseling and screening can help identify carriers and prevent the transmission of the disease to their offspring.\n\nClubfoot is also a congenital condition, and its exact cause is still unknown. However, it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as:\n* Family history\n* Intrauterine position\n* Muscular or nerve abnormalities\n* Environmental factors, such as exposure to certain toxins or viruses during pregnancy\n\nClubfoot can be treated with a variety of methods, including:\n* Casting: to gradually correct the foot's position\n* Bracing: to maintain the corrected position\n* Surgery: to release tight tendons and correct the foot's position\n* Physical therapy: to strengthen the foot and ankle muscles\n\n**3. How common is TSD? How common is Clubfoot?**\n\nTay-Sachs disease is a rare condition, affecting about 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 30,000 births in the general population. However, it is more common in certain ethnic groups, such as Ashkenazi Jews, where it affects about 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 3,000 births.\n\nClubfoot is a relatively common congenital condition, affecting about 1 in 1,000 births. It is more common in boys than girls, and it can occur in one or both feet.\n\n**4. How can your \"agency\" help a woman/couple who are concerned about this congenital condition, and is there a cost?**\n\nAs a hypothetical agency, we can provide the following services to support women and couples concerned about Tay-Sachs disease and clubfoot:\n* Genetic counseling: to discuss the risks and probabilities of inherited conditions\n* Carrier screening: to identify carriers of TSD and other genetic disorders\n* Prenatal testing: to detect potential congenital conditions during pregnancy\n* Referrals to specialists: for further evaluation and treatment of clubfoot or other conditions\n* Emotional support: to provide guidance and reassurance throughout the reproductive journey\n\nThe cost of these services may vary depending on the location, insurance coverage, and specific tests or procedures required.

Persons with Tay-Sachs also have \"cherry-red\" spots in their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0A much rarer form of the disorder, called late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration. The incidence of Tay-Sachs has been particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent., as well as in certain French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns. Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease. Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired. \u00a0A very severe form of Tay-Sachs disease is know as Sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube. Even with the best of care, children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4, from recurring infection.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

I'll do my best to provide you with helpful information and guidance.\n\n**What is lymphedema?**\nLymphedema is a condition characterized by swelling in one or more extremities, such as arms or legs, due to an abnormality in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system helps remove excess fluids, proteins, and waste products from the body. In lymphedema, the lymphatic vessels or nodes are damaged or not functioning properly, leading to a buildup of fluid and swelling.\n\n**Types of lymphedema**\nThere are two main types of lymphedema: primary and secondary. Primary lymphedema is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth, while secondary lymphedema is acquired due to injury, surgery, or infection.\n\n**Milroy disease**\nMilroy disease is a rare, inherited form of primary lymphedema that typically affects the legs. It's caused by a genetic mutation that affects the development of the lymphatic system. Symptoms often appear at birth or during infancy, as in your daughter's case.\n\n**Treatment and management**\nWhile there is no cure for lymphedema, various treatments can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications. The goal of treatment is to reduce swelling, improve mobility, and prevent infections. Here are some possible treatment options:\n\n1. **Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT)**: This is a comprehensive approach that includes manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression bandaging, exercises, and skin care. CDT is usually done by a trained therapist.\n2. **Compression garments**: Specialized compression stockings or sleeves can help reduce swelling by providing graduated pressure.\n3. **Elevation**: Elevating the affected limb above the level of the heart can help reduce swelling.\n4. **Exercise**: Gentle exercises, such as stretching and strengthening, can help improve mobility and reduce swelling.\n5. **Skin care**: Keeping the skin clean and moisturized can help prevent infections.\n6. **Medications**: In some cases, medications like diuretics may be prescribed to help reduce swelling.\n\n**What you can do**\nAs a parent, you play a vital role in your daughter's care. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Consult a specialist**: Schedule an appointment with a pediatrician or a vascular specialist who has experience in treating lymphedema.\n2. **Keep a symptom journal**: Track your daughter's symptoms, including the severity of swelling, any changes, and factors that seem to trigger or relieve symptoms.\n3. **Follow treatment recommendations**: Work with your daughter's healthcare team to develop a treatment plan and follow their recommendations.\n4. **Support and self-care**: Don't forget to take care of yourself, too. Caring for a child with a chronic condition can be stressful, so make sure to seek support from family, friends, or support groups.\n\n**Additional resources**\nFor more information and support, you can reach out to organizations like the National Lymphedema Network (NLN) or the Lymphedema Association of North America (LANA). These organizations offer resources, education, and support for individuals and families affected by lymphedema.\n\nRemember, every child with lymphedema is unique, and it may take some trial and error to find the right treatment approach. Stay positive, and work closely with your daughter's healthcare team to find the best way to manage her symptoms and improve her quality of life.",

I'll do my best to provide you with helpful information and guidance.\n\n**What is lymphedema?**\nLymphedema is a condition characterized by swelling in one or more extremities, such as arms or legs, due to an abnormality in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system helps remove excess fluids, proteins, and waste products from the body. In lymphedema, the lymphatic vessels or nodes are damaged or not functioning properly, leading to a buildup of fluid and swelling.\n\n**Types of lymphedema**\nThere are two main types of lymphedema: primary and secondary. Primary lymphedema is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth, while secondary lymphedema is acquired due to injury, surgery, or infection.\n\n**Milroy disease**\nMilroy disease is a rare, inherited form of primary lymphedema that typically affects the legs. It's caused by a genetic mutation that affects the development of the lymphatic system. Symptoms often appear at birth or during infancy, as in your daughter's case.\n\n**Treatment and management**\nWhile there is no cure for lymphedema, various treatments can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications. The goal of treatment is to reduce swelling, improve mobility, and prevent infections. Here are some possible treatment options:\n\n1. **Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT)**: This is a comprehensive approach that includes manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression bandaging, exercises, and skin care. CDT is usually done by a trained therapist.\n2. **Compression garments**: Specialized compression stockings or sleeves can help reduce swelling by providing graduated pressure.\n3. **Elevation**: Elevating the affected limb above the level of the heart can help reduce swelling.\n4. **Exercise**: Gentle exercises, such as stretching and strengthening, can help improve mobility and reduce swelling.\n5. **Skin care**: Keeping the skin clean and moisturized can help prevent infections.\n6. **Medications**: In some cases, medications like diuretics may be prescribed to help reduce swelling.\n\n**What you can do**\nAs a parent, you play a vital role in your daughter's care. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Consult a specialist**: Schedule an appointment with a pediatrician or a vascular specialist who has experience in treating lymphedema.\n2. **Keep a symptom journal**: Track your daughter's symptoms, including the severity of swelling, any changes, and factors that seem to trigger or relieve symptoms.\n3. **Follow treatment recommendations**: Work with your daughter's healthcare team to develop a treatment plan and follow their recommendations.\n4. **Support and self-care**: Don't forget to take care of yourself, too. Caring for a child with a chronic condition can be stressful, so make sure to seek support from family, friends, or support groups.\n\n**Additional resources**\nFor more information and support, you can reach out to organizations like the National Lymphedema Network (NLN) or the Lymphedema Association of North America (LANA). These organizations offer resources, education, and support for individuals and families affected by lymphedema.\n\nRemember, every child with lymphedema is unique, and it may take some trial and error to find the right treatment approach. Stay positive, and work closely with your daughter's healthcare team to find the best way to manage her symptoms and improve her quality of life.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nMilroy disease (Treatment): There is currently no cure for Milroy disease. Management is typically conservative and usually successful in most people. [3] Management of lymphedema should be guided by a lymphedema therapist. Some improvement is usually possible with the use of properly fitted compression hosiery or bandaging and well fitting, supportive shoes. Good skin care is essential. These measures may improve the cosmetic appearance of the affected areas, decrease their size, and reduce the risk of complications. [2] Decongestive physiotherapy , which combines compression bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage (a specialized massage technique), exercise, breathing exercises, dietary measures and skin care, has become the standard of care for primary lymphedema. [3] People with recurrent cellulitis may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics . [2] [3] Surgical intervention is considered a last option when other medical management fails. [3] When possible, people with Milroy disease should avoid: wounds to swollen areas (because of their reduced resistance to infection) long periods of immobility prolonged standing elevation of the affected limb certain medications (particularly calcium channel-blocking drugs that can cause increased leg swelling in some people)[2] Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

It is characterized by short-limbed dwarfism, polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), and heart defects, among other features. As for your questions regarding later life, fertility, and research, here's what is known:\n\n1. **Later Life Complications and Health**: Individuals with EvC can face various health challenges in later life. The most significant concerns often relate to heart problems, as the condition frequently involves congenital heart defects. Regular cardiac check-ups are crucial to monitor and manage any heart-related issues. Additionally, orthopedic problems due to the skeletal abnormalities can lead to discomfort, mobility issues, and may require surgical interventions.\n\n2. **Fertility**: Fertility in individuals with Ellis-van Creveld syndrome can be affected due to the genetic nature of the disorder. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. There have been reports of individuals with EvC having children, but the likelihood of passing on the condition to their offspring depends on the genetic status of the partner. If two parents with EvC have children, there is a 100% chance that each child will inherit the condition. If one parent has EvC and the other does not have the condition but is a carrier (having one normal and one mutated gene), there is a 50% chance that each child will inherit one mutated gene (becoming a carrier like the unaffected parent) and a 50% chance that each child will inherit two normal genes. The risk of having a child with EvC in this scenario is lower but not zero, as the child of two carriers has a 25% chance of having the syndrome.\n\n3. **Research**: Research into Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is ongoing, with studies focusing on the genetic causes, clinical manifestations, and management of the condition. The EVC and EVC2 genes are primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of EvC, and understanding the function of these genes and how mutations lead to the syndrome's characteristics is a key area of research. Advances in genetic counseling and prenatal testing have improved the ability to diagnose EvC early in pregnancy, allowing for better family planning and preparation for the birth of a child with special needs.\n\n4. **Management and Support**: Management of EvC involves a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers, including geneticists, cardiologists, orthopedic specialists, and sometimes psychologists or counselors for support. Regular monitoring of heart health, management of orthopedic issues, and early intervention for any related developmental delays are crucial. Support groups, both online and in-person, can provide valuable connections for individuals with EvC and their families, offering a community of people who understand the challenges and joys of living with this condition.\n\nIn conclusion, while Ellis-van Creveld syndrome presents several challenges, particularly in relation to heart health and mobility, individuals with the condition can lead fulfilling lives. The possibility of having children exists, but it is essential to understand the genetic risks and consider genetic counseling. Ongoing research aims to improve our understanding of EvC and develop better management strategies, offering hope for improved quality of life for those affected.",

              "text": "autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness: Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

This difficulty can become apparent early in life, often noticed by parents or caregivers when a child has trouble navigating or playing in dimly lit rooms or outdoors at dusk or dawn.\n2. **Normal vision in bright light**: Individuals with congenital night blindness typically have normal vision in bright light conditions. This means that their daytime vision and ability to see colors are usually unaffected.\n3. **Limited or no adaptation to the dark**: People with normal vision can adapt to changes in lighting over time, a process that allows them to see better in the dark after a period of adjustment. Those with congenital night blindness may have a reduced ability or be unable to adapt to dark environments, making it consistently difficult to see in low light.\n\n**When It Becomes Apparent:**\n\nThe symptoms of congenital night blindness can become apparent at different ages, depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's lifestyle. In many cases, parents may notice difficulties when the child starts to become more active and independent, typically during early childhood. However, some individuals may not realize they have the condition until later in life, especially if they have learned to adapt their behaviors to avoid situations where their night vision is significantly impaired.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\nDiagnosing congenital night blindness involves a comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. The diagnosis may include:\n\n- **Visual acuity tests** in different lighting conditions to assess how well a person can see.\n- **Electroretinography (ERG)**, a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light, which can help identify abnormalities in retinal function.\n- **Genetic testing** may be recommended, as some forms of congenital night blindness are inherited.\n\n**Management and Treatment:**\n\nWhile there is no cure for congenital night blindness, there are ways to manage the condition and improve quality of life:\n\n- **Assistive devices**: Using night vision aids, such as special glasses or scopes that amplify available light, can help improve vision in low light.\n- **Lifestyle adjustments**: Avoiding driving at night, using bright lighting at home, especially in stairs and hallways, and developing strategies to safely navigate in low light can mitigate the impact of the condition.\n- **Regular eye care**: Regular check-ups with an eye care professional are crucial to monitor the condition and address any other eye health issues that may arise.\n\nIf you or a family member is experiencing difficulty seeing in low light, it's essential to consult with an eye care professional for a thorough evaluation and appropriate guidance.",

People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

And how severe would you say symptoms may get.\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nI must emphasize that oleander (Nerium oleander) is a highly toxic plant, and ingesting even small amounts can be life-threatening. If you suspect oleander poisoning, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately.\n\nAssuming the person touched the plant's stem's inner part and then ate something without washing their hands, the symptoms of oleander poisoning may start within 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingestion. The exact timing depends on factors such as the amount of toxin absorbed, the individual's sensitivity, and the route of exposure.\n\nThe symptoms of oleander poisoning can be severe and may include:\n\n1. **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain can occur within 30 minutes to 1 hour after ingestion.\n2. **Cardiovascular symptoms**: The toxic compounds in oleander, such as oleandrin and neriine, can affect the heart, leading to:\n\t* Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n\t* Low blood pressure (hypotension)\n\t* Cardiac arrest (in severe cases)\n3. **Neurological symptoms**: Headache, drowsiness, confusion, and tremors may occur within 1-2 hours after ingestion.\n4. **Other symptoms**: The person may also experience:\n\t* Dizziness or fainting\n\t* Weakness or fatigue\n\t* Seizures (in rare cases)\n\nThe severity of the symptoms can vary depending on the amount of toxin absorbed and the individual's overall health. In general, oleander poisoning can be fatal if not treated promptly and properly.\n\n**Severity levels**:\n\n* Mild: Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, may be the only symptoms present.\n* Moderate: Cardiovascular symptoms, such as abnormal heart rhythms, may occur, and the person may experience neurological symptoms like headache and drowsiness.\n* Severe: The person may experience cardiac arrest, seizures, or respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.\n\nIt is essential to remember that even small amounts of oleander can be toxic, and the symptoms can progress rapidly. If you suspect oleander poisoning, call your local emergency number or the national poison control center (1-800-222-1222 in the United States) immediately.\n\n**Treatment**:\n\nIf oleander poisoning is suspected, the person should be taken to the hospital immediately. Treatment may involve:\n\n1. Activated charcoal administration to reduce toxin absorption\n2. Gastric lavage (stomach pumping)\n3. Cardiovascular and respiratory support\n4. Administration of antidotes, such as atropine or digoxin-specific antibody fragments (if available)\n5. Close monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function\n\nPrevention is key. When handling oleander plants, it is crucial to wear protective gloves and wash your hands thoroughly after touching the plant. If you have any concerns or questions, consult with a healthcare professional or a poison control center.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nOleander poisoning: Oleander poisoning occurs when someone eats the flowers or chews the leaves or stems of the oleander plant\u00a0(Nerium oleander), or its relative, the yellow oleander (Cascabela thevetia). This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous ingredients include: - Digitoxigenin - Neriin - Oleandrin - Oleondroside Note: This list may not include all poisonous ingredients. The poisonous substances are found in all parts of the oleander plant: - Flowers - Leaves - Stems - Twigs Oleander poisoning can affect many parts of the body. HEART AND BLOOD - Irregular or slow heartbeat - Low blood pressure - Weakness EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROAT - Blurred vision - Vision disturbances, including halos STOMACH AND INTESTINES - Diarrhea - Loss of appetite - Nausea and vomiting - Stomach pain NERVOUS SYSTEM - Confusion - Death - Depression - Disorientation - Dizziness - Drowsiness - Fainting - Headache - Lethargy SKIN - Hives - Rash Note: Depression, loss of appetite, and halos are most often seen in chronic overdose cases. Seek immediate medical help. DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider. Get the following information: - Person's age, weight, and condition - Name and part of the plant swallowed, if known - Time it was swallowed - Amount swallowed Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does not need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive: - Activated charcoal - Blood and urine tests - Breathing support - Chest x-ray - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) - Fluids through a vein (IV) - Medicines to treat symptoms including an antidote to reverse the effects of the poison - Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage) How well you do depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster you get medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Symptoms last for 1 to 3 days and may require a hospital stay. Death is unlikely. DO NOT touch or eat any plant with which you are not familiar. Wash your hands after working in the garden or walking in the woods.

The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma. Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include: - Brain tumor - Cranial arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis) - Multiple sclerosis - Stroke There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults. Optic nerve atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded. Over time, the pupil will be less able to react to light, and eventually,\u00a0its ability to react to light may be lost. The health care provider will do a complete eye exam to look for the condition. The exam will include tests of: - Color vision - Pupil light reflex - Tonometry - Visual acuity You may also need a complete physical exam and other tests. Damage from optic nerve atrophy cannot be reversed. The underlying disease must be found and treated. Otherwise, vision loss will continue. Rarely, conditions that lead to optic atrophy may be treatable. Vision lost to optic nerve atrophy cannot be recovered. It is very important to protect the other eye. People with this condition need to be checked regularly by an eye doctor with experience in nerve-related conditions. Tell your doctor right away about any change in vision. Many causes of optic nerve atrophy cannot be prevented. Prevention steps include: - Older adults should have their provider carefully manage their blood pressure. - Use standard safety precautions to prevent injuries to the face. Most facial injuries are the result of car accidents. Wearing seat belts may help prevent these injuries. - Schedule a routine annual eye exam to check for glaucoma. - Never drink home-brewed alcohol and forms of alcohol that are not intended for drinking. Methanol, which is found in home-brewed alcohol, can cause optic nerve atrophy in both eyes. Updated by: Franklin W. Lusby, MD, ophthalmologist, Lusby Vision Institute, La Jolla, CA.

Genetic forms of optic atrophy are inherited and can be present from birth or develop during childhood or early adulthood. These genetic conditions can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial pattern, depending on the specific mutation or condition.\n\nSome genetic conditions that can cause optic atrophy include:\n\n1. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):** A rare inherited disorder that primarily affects young adult males, leading to sudden and irreversible vision loss in one eye, followed by the other eye.\n2. **Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA):** A condition characterized by progressive vision loss, usually starting in childhood, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\n3. **Recessively Inherited Optic Atrophy:** Less common than dominant forms, this can be part of syndromes that affect multiple systems of the body.\n\n**Acquired Causes of Optic Atrophy**\n\nNot all cases of optic atrophy are genetic. Acquired optic atrophy can result from various factors and conditions, including:\n\n1. **Trauma:** Direct injury to the optic nerve can cause atrophy.\n2. **Infections:** Certain infections, such as meningitis or syphilis, can damage the optic nerve.\n3. **Tumors:** Tumors pressing on the optic nerve can cause atrophy.\n4. **Vascular Disorders:** Conditions like anterior ischemic optic neuropathy can damage the optic nerve due to insufficient blood supply.\n5. **Toxic and Nutritional Factors:** Exposure to certain toxins (e.g., methanol) or nutritional deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency) can affect the optic nerve.\n6. **Glaucoma:** Untreated or inadequately managed glaucoma can lead to optic atrophy.\n7. **Stroke or Cerebral Vasculitis:** Conditions affecting the brain's blood vessels can indirectly cause optic atrophy by damaging the optic nerve.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nDiagnosing optic atrophy involves a comprehensive eye examination, including visual acuity testing, fundoscopy to examine the optic nerve, and potentially, imaging studies like MRI or OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) to visualize the optic nerve and rule out other causes like tumors.

              "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin - Eyes - Lungs - Heart - Kidneys - Salivary glands - Nerve tissue - Bone marrow - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium - the lining of the membranes that surround your joints. The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch. Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment. Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors - such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria - that may trigger the disease. Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include: - Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis. - Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60. - Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Blood tests People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. Imaging tests Your doctor may recommend X-rays to help track the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in your joints over time. MRI and ultrasound tests can help your doctor judge the severity of the disease in your body. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But recent discoveries indicate that remission of symptoms is more likely when treatment begins early with strong medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Medications The types of medications recommended by your doctor will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how long you've had rheumatoid arthritis. - NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects may include ringing in your ears, stomach irritation, heart problems, and liver and kidney damage. - Steroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes. Doctors often prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve acute symptoms, with the goal of gradually tapering off the medication. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. Common DMARDs include methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo), leflunomide (Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects vary but may include liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infections. - Biologic agents. Also known as biologic response modifiers, this newer class of DMARDs includes abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan), tocilizumab (Actemra) and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). These drugs can target parts of the immune system that trigger inflammation that causes joint and tissue damage. These types of drugs also increase the risk of infections. Biologic DMARDs are usually most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD, such as methotrexate. Therapy Your doctor may send you to a physical or occupational therapist who can teach you exercises to help keep your joints flexible. The therapist may also suggest new ways to do daily tasks, which will be easier on your joints. For example, if your fingers are sore, you may want to pick up an object using your forearms. Assistive devices can make it easier to avoid stressing your painful joints. For instance, a kitchen knife equipped with a saw handle helps protect your finger and wrist joints. Certain tools, such as buttonhooks, can make it easier to get dressed. Catalogs and medical supply stores are good places to look for ideas. Surgery If medications fail to prevent or slow joint damage, you and your doctor may consider surgery to repair damaged joints. Surgery may help restore your ability to use your joint. It can also reduce pain and correct deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis surgery may involve one or more of the following procedures: - Synovectomy. Surgery to remove the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint). Synovectomy can be performed on knees, elbows, wrists, fingers and hips. - Tendon repair. Inflammation and joint damage may cause tendons around your joint to loosen or rupture. Your surgeon may be able to repair the tendons around your joint. - Joint fusion. Surgically fusing a joint may be recommended to stabilize or realign a joint and for pain relief when a joint replacement isn't an option. - Total joint replacement. During joint replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the damaged parts of your joint and inserts a prosthesis made of metal and plastic. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding, infection and pain. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. You can take steps to care for your body if you have rheumatoid arthritis. These self-care measures, when used along with your rheumatoid arthritis medications, can help you manage your signs and symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, and it can help fight fatigue you might feel. Check with your doctor before you start exercising. If you're just getting started, begin by taking a walk. Try swimming or gentle water aerobics. Avoid exercising tender, injured or severely inflamed joints. - Apply heat or cold. Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull the sensation of pain. Cold also has a numbing effect and decreases muscle spasms. - Relax. Find ways to cope with pain by reducing stress in your life. Techniques such as guided imagery, distraction and muscle relaxation can all be used to control pain. Some common complementary and alternative treatments that have shown promise for rheumatoid arthritis include: - Fish oil. Some preliminary studies have found that fish oil supplements may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain and stiffness. Side effects can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. Fish oil can interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Plant oils. The seeds of evening primrose, borage and black currant contain a type of fatty acid that may help with rheumatoid arthritis pain and morning stiffness. Side effects may include nausea, diarrhea and gas. Some plant oils can cause liver damage or interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Tai chi. This movement therapy involves gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use tai chi to relieve stress in their lives. Small studies have found that tai chi may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, tai chi is safe. But don't do any moves that cause pain."

The signs and symptoms associated with the condition vary based on how much of the brain and which areas of the brain are affected; however, affected people may experience recurrent seizures ( epilepsy ); delayed development; crossed eyes ; problems with speech and swallowing; and muscle weakness or paralysis. Bilateral forms (affecting both sides of the brain) tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Polymicrogyria can result from both genetic and environmental causes. It may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome . Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] A wide variety of symptoms may be observed in people with polymicrogyria, depending on the areas of the brain implicated and whether or not it is part of a larger syndrome . Signs and symptoms may include: [3] [4] Developmental delay Crossed eyes Epilepsy Paralysis of the face, throat, and tongue Difficulty with speech and swallowing Drooling The diagnosis of polymicrogyria is made by imaging brain structures using\u00a0 MRI . Typical findings include areas of the\u00a0 cerebral cortex\u00a0with a complex set of small gyri that appear fused to each other and separated by shallow sulci. These findings may be isolated to one side of the brain (unilateral) or may involve both sides of the brain (bilateral).

Specifically, the surface of the brain develops too many folds which are unusually small. The signs and symptoms associated with the condition vary based on how much of the brain and which areas of the brain are affected; however, affected people may experience recurrent seizures ( epilepsy ); delayed development; crossed eyes ; problems with speech and swallowing; and muscle weakness or paralysis. Bilateral forms (affecting both sides of the brain) tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Polymicrogyria can result from both genetic and environmental causes. It may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome . Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] A wide variety of symptoms may be observed in people with polymicrogyria, depending on the areas of the brain implicated and whether or not it is part of a larger syndrome . Signs and symptoms may include: [3] [4] Developmental delay Crossed eyes Epilepsy Paralysis of the face, throat, and tongue Difficulty with speech and swallowing Drooling The diagnosis of polymicrogyria is made by imaging brain structures using\u00a0 MRI . Typical findings include areas of the\u00a0 cerebral cortex\u00a0with a complex set of small gyri that appear fused to each other and separated by shallow sulci. These findings may be isolated to one side of the brain (unilateral) or may involve both sides of the brain (bilateral). [3] [4] The resources below provide information about treatment options for this condition. If you have questions about which treatment is right for you, talk to your healthcare professional. Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.

              "text": "Leukemia (Treatment): Treatment for your leukemia depends on many factors. Your doctor determines your leukemia treatment options based on your age and overall health, the type of leukemia you have, and whether it has spread to other parts of your body, including the central nervous system. Common treatments used to fight leukemia include: - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells. Depending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein. - Biological therapy. Biological therapy works by using treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack leukemia cells. - Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific vulnerabilities within your cancer cells. For example, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) stops the action of a protein within the leukemia cells of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. This can help control the disease. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body. You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a stem cell transplant. - Stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. Before a stem cell transplant, you receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help to rebuild your bone marrow. You may receive stem cells from a donor, or in some cases you may be able to use your own stem cells. A stem cell transplant is very similar to a bone marrow transplant."

            "text": "I'd be happy to help you with your school project about leukemia! Here are the answers to your questions:\n\n1. **What causes leukemia cancer?**\nLeukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It's caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as exposure to radiation, certain chemicals, and viruses. In some cases, leukemia can be caused by genetic mutations or inherited genetic disorders. However, the exact cause of leukemia is still not fully understood and is often the result of a combination of factors.\n\n2. **Can you survive leukemia?**\nYes, many people can survive leukemia, especially if it's detected and treated early. The survival rate depends on the type of leukemia, the stage of the disease, and the individual's overall health. With advances in medical treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation, the survival rate for leukemia has improved significantly over the years.\n\n3. **How does leukemia affect your body?**\nLeukemia affects the blood and bone marrow, which are responsible for producing healthy blood cells. When leukemia develops, it can lead to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, which can crowd out healthy blood cells and cause a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, anemia, infections, and bleeding problems. Leukemia can also affect other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen.\n\n4. **Is leukemia inherited?**\nIn most cases, leukemia is not inherited. However, some genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and ataxia-telangiectasia, can increase the risk of developing leukemia. Additionally, some families may have a higher risk of developing leukemia due to genetic mutations, but this is relatively rare.\n\n5. **What is advanced leukemia?**\nAdvanced leukemia refers to leukemia that has progressed to a later stage, where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, or spleen. At this stage, the leukemia is more difficult to treat, and the prognosis is generally poorer.\n\n6. **How long can someone with leukemia expect to live?**\nThe life expectancy for someone with leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, the stage of the disease, and the individual's overall health. According to the passage you provided, the mean survival time for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was 265.5 days. However, with modern treatment, many people with leukemia can live for several years or even decades after diagnosis.\n\n7. **Can you tell if you have leukemia?**\nLeukemia can be difficult to detect in its early stages, as the symptoms may be similar to those of other illnesses. However, common signs and symptoms of leukemia include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, frequent infections, and unexplained bruising or bleeding. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's essential to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\n8. **What treatments do you need to take?**\nThe treatment for leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, the stage of the disease, and the individual's overall health. Common treatments for leukemia include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow transplantation, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. In some cases, patients may need to undergo a combination of these treatments.\n\n9. **What are the signs of leukemia?**\nCommon signs and symptoms of leukemia include:\n* Fatigue and weakness\n* Pale skin\n* Shortness of breath\n* Frequent infections\n* Unexplained bruising or bleeding\n* Weight loss\n* Night sweats\n* Bone or joint pain\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\n10. **What is the difference between AML and CML?**\nAcute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) are two types of leukemia that affect the blood and bone marrow. The main difference between them is the rate at which they progress:\n* AML is a rapidly progressing disease that develops quickly and requires immediate treatment.\n* CML is a slower progressing disease that can take years to develop and may not require immediate treatment.\nAML tends to be more aggressive than CML and requires more intensive treatment. CML, on the other hand, can often be managed with targeted therapy and may have a better prognosis.\n\nI hope these answers help you with your school project!

Three treatment options are available: - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments. - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments. - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis. TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL) Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include: - Cortisone creams and ointments - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid) - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) - Moisturizers - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used. Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: - Adalimumab (Humira) - Etanercept (Enbrel) - Infliximab (Remicade) - Ustekinumab (Stelara) - Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - Apremilast (Otezla) - Ixekizumab (Taltz) PHOTOTHERAPY Some people may choose to have phototherapy: - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light. - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light. OTHER TREATMENTS If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. HOME CARE Following these tips at home may help: - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (240 mL) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water. - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned. - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood. - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse."

Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. One of the most promising MS research areas involves naturally occurring antiviral proteins known as interferons. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe. In addition, there are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models. In 2001, the National Academies/Institute of Medicine, a Federal technical and scientific advisory agency, prepared a strategic review of MS research.

            "text": "I'm happy to help you with your research assignment on neurological disorders, specifically Multiple Sclerosis (MS). While it's challenging to predict a exact timeline for a cure, I'll provide you with an overview of the current state of research and potential future directions.\n\nMultiple Sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), causing damage to the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. The exact cause of MS is still not fully understood, but it's believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and infectious factors.\n\nCurrently, there is no definitive cure for Multiple Sclerosis. However, researchers are actively exploring various treatment strategies to manage the disease, slow its progression, and improve symptoms. Some promising areas of research include:\n\n1. **Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs)**: These medications aim to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, slow disease progression, and manage symptoms. Examples include injectable medications like interferon beta and glatiramer acetate, as well as oral medications like fingolimod and teriflunomide.\n2. **Stem Cell Therapies**: Researchers are investigating the potential of stem cells to repair damaged tissue in the CNS. This includes studies on mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells.\n3. **Gene Therapy**: Scientists are exploring the use of gene therapy to modify or replace genes involved in the development of MS.

Good luck with your assignment!\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nwhat research (or clinical trials) is being done for Multiple Sclerosis?: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. One of the most promising MS research areas involves naturally occurring antiviral proteins known as interferons. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe. In addition, there are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models. In 2001, the National Academies/Institute of Medicine, a Federal technical and scientific advisory agency, prepared a strategic review of MS research.

              "text": "Prostate cancer - treatment: Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment. Sometimes your doctor may recommend 1 treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be 2 or more treatments that could be good for you. Factors you and your doctor must think about include: - Your age and other medical problems you may have - Side effects that occur with each type of treatment - How much the prostate cancer has spread - Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread - Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result Ask your doctor to explain these things following about your treatment choices: - Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread? - How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure. Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone. External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland: - Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated. - Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless. - Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital. - Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. Side effects may include: - Appetite loss - Diarrhea - Erection problems - Fatigue - Rectal burning or injury - Skin reactions - Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well. Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland. - A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them. - The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include: - Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum - Red-brown urine or semen - Impotence - Incontinence - Urinary retention - Diarrhea Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body's immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

Consult with your healthcare provider to determine the most suitable treatment approach for your specific condition.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nProstate cancer - treatment: Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment. Sometimes your doctor may recommend 1 treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be 2 or more treatments that could be good for you. Factors you and your doctor must think about include: - Your age and other medical problems you may have - Side effects that occur with each type of treatment - How much the prostate cancer has spread - Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread - Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result Ask your doctor to explain these things following about your treatment choices: - Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread? - How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure. Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone. External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland: - Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated. - Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless. - Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital. - Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. Side effects may include: - Appetite loss - Diarrhea - Erection problems - Fatigue - Rectal burning or injury - Skin reactions - Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well. Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland. - A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them. - The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include: - Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum - Red-brown urine or semen - Impotence - Incontinence - Urinary retention - Diarrhea Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body's immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

It's possible for vaccinated individuals to still contract the virus, although this is less common. The first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually administered to children around 12 to 15 months of age, and a second dose is given around 4 to 6 years of age. If your grandson has only received one dose, he might not have had the full series, which could explain why he contracted Rubella.\n\n2. **Health Implications**: For a healthy child like your grandson, Rubella is usually a mild illness, characterized by a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to other parts of the body. However, it's essential to monitor his condition to ensure it doesn't worsen. Complications can occur but are rare in children.\n\n3. **Exposure Risks**: Since your grandson is living in Mexico, it's crucial to consider the risk of exposure to others, particularly pregnant women or individuals who are not vaccinated or have weakened immune systems. Rubella can cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if a pregnant woman passes the virus to her unborn child, leading to severe birth defects.\n\n4. **Medical Care in Mexico**: Ensure that your grandson receives appropriate medical care in Mexico. While the healthcare system in Mexico can provide good care, there might be differences in how diseases are managed compared to what you're used to. It's essential to follow the advice of local healthcare professionals and to ensure that your grandson's condition is monitored.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures**: To prevent the spread of Rubella, it's crucial to practice good hygiene, such as frequent hand washing, covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding close contact with others, especially those who are at high risk of complications.\n\n6. **Follow-Up Vaccination**: Once your grandson has recovered, consult with his healthcare provider about the need for an additional dose of the MMR vaccine to ensure he has optimal protection against Rubella and other diseases prevented by the vaccine.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's concerning that your vaccinated grandson contracted Rubella, the illness is generally mild in healthy children. The key is to monitor his condition, prevent the spread to others, especially high-risk individuals, and consider follow-up vaccination advice from healthcare professionals.

              "text": "Spina bifida (Treatment): Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn't require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do. Surgery before birth Nerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if it's not treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, and potential benefits for you and your baby. It's important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist. Cesarean birth Many babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby. Surgery after birth Meningocele involves surgery to put the meninges back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Because the spinal cord develops normally in babies with meningocele, these membranes often can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that's associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby's brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord. Treatment for complications In babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications - such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems or hydrocephalus - typically begins soon after birth. Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life, but less often as children grow. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. - For children, a specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida is the best choice. - Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a ventricular shunt - a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen. This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be used, but candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain. - Treatment and management of other complications. To help with functioning, special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may be needed. Whatever the issue - orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems, or others - most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life. Ongoing care Children with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation. Their primary care doctors follow growth, the need for immunizations and general medical issues. They coordinate your child's medical care. Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child's condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible."

Treatment for a syrinx tethered cord usually involves surgery to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and prevent further damage.\n\n**Treatment Options:**\nTreatment for these conditions typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including:\n\n1. **Surgery:** Surgical procedures, such as vertebral fusion and untethering of the spinal cord, may be necessary to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and prevent further damage.\n2. **Physical Therapy:** Physical therapy can help improve mobility, strength, and flexibility, as well as manage pain and discomfort.\n3. **Pain Management:** Pain management techniques, such as medication and alternative therapies, can help alleviate pain and discomfort.\n4. **Urology and Gastroenterology Care:** Patients with spina bifida may require ongoing care from urologists and gastroenterologists to manage bladder and bowel dysfunction.\n5. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular monitoring by a healthcare team is essential to prevent complications and manage symptoms effectively.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon, to determine the best course of treatment for your specific condition. They can help develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your unique needs and goals.\n\nI hope this information helps! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nSpina bifida (Treatment): Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn't require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do. Surgery before birth Nerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if it's not treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, and potential benefits for you and your baby. It's important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist. Cesarean birth Many babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby. Surgery after birth Meningocele involves surgery to put the meninges back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Because the spinal cord develops normally in babies with meningocele, these membranes often can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that's associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby's brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord. Treatment for complications In babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications - such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems or hydrocephalus - typically begins soon after birth. Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life, but less often as children grow. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. - For children, a specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida is the best choice. - Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a ventricular shunt - a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen. This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be used, but candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain. - Treatment and management of other complications. To help with functioning, special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may be needed. Whatever the issue - orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems, or others - most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life. Ongoing care Children with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation. Their primary care doctors follow growth, the need for immunizations and general medical issues. They coordinate your child's medical care. Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child's condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Let's break them down:\n\n**Subcutaneous retrocalcaneal bursitis:**\nThis condition occurs when the bursa (a fluid-filled sac) located between the Achilles tendon and the heel bone (calcaneus) becomes inflamed. The bursa helps reduce friction between the tendon and the bone, allowing for smooth movement of the ankle joint. When it becomes inflamed, it can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the back of the heel.\n\n**Haglund's deformity:**\nAlso known as \"pump bump,\" Haglund's deformity is a bony growth on the back of the heel bone (calcaneus). It's usually caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as:\n\n* Abnormal foot mechanics (e.g., overpronation or flat feet)\n* Tight Achilles tendon\n* Wearing high-heeled shoes or shoes with a rigid back\n* Running or repetitive activities that put stress on the heel\n\nThe bony growth can irritate the surrounding tissues, including the bursa, leading to inflammation and pain.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCommon symptoms of subcutaneous retrocalcaneal bursitis and Haglund's deformity include:\n\n* Pain and swelling in the back of the heel\n* Redness and warmth in the affected area\n* Limited ankle mobility\n* Stiffness or tenderness in the heel\n* Pain when wearing shoes or walking\n\n**Treatment and management:**\nTo overcome this condition, try the following:\n\n1. **Rest and ice:** Avoid activities that aggravate the condition, and apply ice to the affected area to reduce pain and inflammation.\n2. **Stretching and exercises:** Stretch your Achilles tendon and calf muscles to reduce tension and promote healing. You can try exercises like calf raises, heel raises, and toe curls.\n3. **Physical therapy:** A physical therapist can help you with stretching, strengthening, and foot orthotics to address any underlying foot mechanics issues.\n4. **Footwear modifications:** Wear shoes with a soft, cushioned heel counter and avoid high-heeled shoes. You can also try using shoe inserts or orthotics to reduce pressure on the heel.\n5. **Medications:** Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce pain and inflammation. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe stronger medications or inject corticosteroids into the bursa to reduce inflammation.\n6. **Surgery:** In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the bony growth or repair any damaged tissues.\n\n**Lifestyle changes:**\nTo prevent future occurrences, consider the following lifestyle changes:\n\n* Wear comfortable, supportive shoes\n* Avoid repetitive activities that put stress on the heel\n* Maintain a healthy weight to reduce pressure on the heel\n* Stretch regularly to keep your Achilles tendon and calf muscles flexible\n\n**Consult a healthcare professional:**\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare professional, such as an orthopedic doctor or a podiatrist, to receive a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can help you determine the best course of treatment and provide guidance on managing your condition.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand and manage your condition.

              "text": "Dizziness: Dizziness is a term used to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or unsteady. Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It's usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) - Lightheadedness or feeling faint - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache - Ongoing vomiting - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing - Stumbling or difficulty walking - Fainting - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate - Numbness or weakness - Shortness of breath - A high fever - A very stiff neck - A head injury - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis. - Meniere's disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear. - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension. - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance. - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much. - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia). - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety. - Overheating and dehydration. If you're active in hot weather, or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness. - A past episode of dizziness. If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you're having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina or blood vessel problems. - Balance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you're experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These may cause drowsiness. Nondrowsy antihistamines aren't as effective. - If your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration, rest in a cool place and drink water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others)."

Macular degeneration, specifically, is a condition that affects the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision, fine detail, and color perception. While it primarily affects vision, particularly central vision, it is less commonly associated directly with causing dizziness or vertigo.\n\nHowever, it's possible that macular degeneration in one eye could indirectly contribute to feelings of dizziness or imbalance, especially if the vision loss is significant and affects the person's overall balance and spatial orientation. Here are a few ways in which vision problems, including macular degeneration, might influence balance:\n\n1. **Depth Perception**: Significant vision loss in one eye can affect depth perception, making it more challenging to judge distances and navigate stairs or uneven surfaces. This could potentially lead to a feeling of instability or increased risk of falls, which might be perceived as dizziness.\n\n2. **Visual Dependence**: Some people rely heavily on visual input for balance. If macular degeneration significantly impairs vision in one eye, it could affect the body's ability to use visual cues for balance, potentially leading to a sensation of dizziness or unsteadiness.\n\n3. **Compensatory Mechanisms**: When one eye has impaired vision, the body might compensate by relying more on the other eye or on other senses (like the vestibular system in the ears or proprioception from the muscles and joints). This adjustment could sometimes lead to temporary feelings of dizziness as the body adapts.\n\nIt's essential to note that macular degeneration itself is not typically considered a direct cause of dizziness or vertigo. If you're experiencing dizziness and have macular degeneration, it's possible that another condition is causing your symptoms. Consulting with a healthcare provider, such as an ophthalmologist for eye-related concerns or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist or a neurologist for balance issues, can help determine the underlying cause of your dizziness and provide appropriate treatment options.\n\nIn summary, while macular degeneration in one eye is unlikely to be a direct cause of dizziness, significant vision loss can indirectly affect balance and spatial orientation, potentially leading to feelings of instability or dizziness.

Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It's usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) - Lightheadedness or feeling faint - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache - Ongoing vomiting - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing - Stumbling or difficulty walking - Fainting - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate - Numbness or weakness - Shortness of breath - A high fever - A very stiff neck - A head injury - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis. - Meniere's disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear. - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension. - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance. - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much. - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia). - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety. - Overheating and dehydration. If you're active in hot weather, or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness. - A past episode of dizziness. If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you're having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments.

It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you're experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine).

This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as not drinking enough water, sweating too much, having a fever, or experiencing vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nWhen a person is severely dehydrated, they may experience a range of symptoms, including:\n\n1. **Excessive thirst**: One of the first signs of dehydration.\n2. **Dark urine**: If the urine is dark yellow or amber-colored, it may indicate dehydration.\n3. **Fatigue**: Feeling weak or tired.\n4. **Headaches**: Dehydration can cause headaches due to the lack of fluids.\n5. **Dizziness or lightheadedness**: Standing up too quickly can lead to dizziness or feeling faint.\n6. **Rapid heartbeat**: The heart may beat faster to compensate for the decreased volume of blood.\n\nRegarding the specific symptom of a tight pain in the chest (right below the breasts) before fainting or passing out due to severe dehydration, it's essential to understand that dehydration can lead to a range of complications affecting various bodily systems, including the cardiovascular system.\n\nThe symptom described could potentially be related to several factors associated with severe dehydration:\n- **Electrolyte imbalance**: Dehydration can lead to an imbalance of essential electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and chloride. This imbalance can affect the heart's functioning and may cause chest pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest.\n- **Decreased blood volume**: Severe dehydration reduces the volume of blood circulating in the body, which can lead to a decrease in blood pressure. This reduction can impair the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently, potentially leading to symptoms like chest discomfort or pain, especially if the heart is working harder to compensate for the lack of volume.\n- **Dehydration effects on the heart**: In severe cases, dehydration can lead to more serious heart problems, including arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). Though less common, severe dehydration can also precipitate heart attacks in vulnerable individuals, which could manifest as chest pain.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that chest pain, especially if it's a new symptom, should always be evaluated by a healthcare professional. While the chest pain described could be related to dehydration, especially in the context of severe dehydration leading to fainting or passing out, it could also be indicative of other serious conditions that require immediate medical attention.\n\nIn summary, while severe dehydration can lead to a variety of systemic effects, including some that might result in chest discomfort, any symptom of chest pain should be medically evaluated to rule out other serious causes. If someone is experiencing severe dehydration to the point of feeling like they might faint, along with chest pain, it's essential to seek immediate medical help.",

            "text": "I understand that you're seeking information on treatment options for optic nerve atrophy, a condition you've been living with since 1998 after a fall. Optic nerve atrophy is a condition where the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain, becomes damaged, leading to vision loss. The treatment and management of optic nerve atrophy depend on the underlying cause and the extent of the damage.\n\nGiven your history, including the fall in 1998 and subsequent surgeries and treatments, it's essential to approach your situation with a comprehensive medical evaluation. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Causes and Treatment Approaches**: The treatment for optic nerve atrophy can vary based on its cause. If the atrophy is due to a compressive lesion (like a tumor), surgery might be indicated. For traumatic optic neuropathy, which could be relevant in your case given the history of a fall, treatment might include observation, corticosteroids, or surgical decompression of the optic nerve.\n\n2. **Current Treatment Options**: There have been advancements in the treatment of various neurological and ophthalmological conditions, including optic nerve atrophy. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can depend on the cause and severity of the condition. For some cases of optic nerve atrophy, especially those associated with autoimmune conditions or certain metabolic disorders, specific treatments targeting the underlying cause might be available.\n\n3. **Russian Professor's Treatment**: You mentioned being treated by a Russian professor in 2009, which suggests you've explored international treatment options. Without more details about the specific treatment you received, it's challenging to assess its impact or potential for future treatments.\n\n4. **Cost of Treatment**: The cost of treatment for optic nerve atrophy can vary widely depending on the type of treatment, the location (country, region, or specific hospital), and the healthcare system in place. Advanced treatments, surgical interventions, or long-term management strategies can be costly. It's essential to consult with healthcare providers directly to get a more accurate estimate of the costs involved.\n\n5. **Hope for Vision Recovery**: While there are instances where vision can improve with appropriate treatment, especially if the underlying cause is addressed promptly, the likelihood of significant recovery in cases of long-standing optic nerve atrophy might be limited. However, ongoing research into nerve regeneration, stem cell therapies, and other advanced medical treatments offers hope for future possibilities.\n\nGiven your specific situation and the desire for detailed information on treatment options, including costs, I recommend the following steps:\n\n- **Consult a Specialist**: Reach out to a neuro-ophthalmologist or a retina specialist who can evaluate your case in detail, considering your history and current condition. They can provide insights into potential treatment options and their feasibility.\n\n- **Second Opinion**: Consider seeking a second opinion from another specialist, possibly in a different country or a renowned medical center, to explore all potential avenues for treatment.\n\n- **Research and Clinical Trials**: Look into clinical trials or research studies focused on optic nerve atrophy and related conditions. Participating in a clinical trial might offer access to new, experimental treatments.\n\n- **Support Groups**: Connecting with support groups for individuals with vision loss or optic nerve atrophy can provide emotional support and practical advice on living with the condition.\n\nRemember, each case of optic nerve atrophy is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. Approaching your situation with a combination of medical evaluation, exploration of treatment options, and consideration of new developments in the field will be crucial in determining the best course of action for you.",

The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers. A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers. If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include: - Antidepressants - Blood pressure medicines - Seizure medicines Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month. Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you. TREATING AN ATTACK Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that: - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine. - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys. If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.\u00a0The group of medicines most often used is called triptans. Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself. Feverfew is an herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs."

This is because different migraine types and subtypes may have distinct underlying pathophysiologies, requiring tailored treatment approaches.\n\nResearchers have made efforts to characterize the effectiveness of various treatments for different migraine types. For example:\n\n1. **Triptans**: These medications are generally effective for migraines with or without aura, but may be more effective for migraines without aura.\n2. **Ergotamines**: These are often used for migraines with aura, but can be effective for both types.\n3. **Anti-depressants** (e.g., amitriptyline): These may be more effective for migraines with aura or for patients with co-morbid depression.\n4. **Anti-epileptics** (e.g., topiramate): These can be effective for both migraine types, but may be more effective for migraines with aura.\n5. **CGRP inhibitors**: These are a new class of medications that have shown promise in treating migraines with or without aura.\n6. **Non-pharmacological treatments** (e.g., QEEG, HEG, TMS): These may be more effective for specific subtypes of migraines, such as those with aura or those with a strong neurological component.\n\nThe study you mentioned, which examined the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in female patients with migraine, highlights the importance of considering the specific characteristics of each patient's migraine when selecting a treatment.

This system categorizes migraines into several subtypes, including:\n\n1. Migraine without aura\n2. Migraine with aura\n3. Chronic migraine\n4. Episodic migraine\n5.

Typhoid fever is a serious infection caused by the Salmonella Typhi bacteria, and it's essential to address your concerns to ensure you receive proper care.\n\nFirstly, it's crucial to understand that typhoid fever can have a prolonged recovery period, and some people may experience lingering symptoms or complications, even after treatment. If you've been undergoing treatment for a year and still don't feel well, there could be several reasons for this:\n\n1. **Incomplete treatment**: It's possible that the initial treatment may not have been fully effective, or the bacteria may have developed resistance to the antibiotics used.\n2. **Re-infection**: You may have been re-infected with the Salmonella Typhi bacteria, which can happen if you're exposed to contaminated food, water, or close contact with someone who has the infection.\n3. **Underlying health issues**: Certain underlying health conditions, such as gallbladder disease, liver or kidney problems, or immunodeficiency disorders, can increase the risk of complications or prolonged recovery from typhoid fever.\n4. **Other infections or conditions**: You may be experiencing symptoms similar to typhoid fever, but caused by a different infection or condition, such as a viral or parasitic infection, or a non-infectious condition like inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nTo address your concerns, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult your doctor**: Schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor to discuss your ongoing symptoms and treatment. They will help determine the cause of your lingering symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n2. **Review your treatment history**: Provide your doctor with detailed information about your treatment, including the antibiotics used, dosage, and duration. This will help them assess the effectiveness of your previous treatment.\n3. **Get tested again**: Your doctor may recommend additional tests, such as blood cultures, stool tests, or imaging studies, to rule out other infections or conditions.\n4. **Consider a second opinion**: If you're not seeing improvement, you may want to seek a second opinion from a specialist, such as an infectious disease expert or a gastroenterologist.\n5. **Practice good hygiene and prevention**: To reduce the risk of re-infection, make sure to practice good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, proper food handling, and safe drinking water.\n\nIn terms of specific solutions, your doctor may consider:\n\n1. **Antibiotic therapy**: Adjusting your antibiotic treatment to ensure you're receiving the most effective medication for your specific case.\n2. **Supportive care**: Providing supportive care, such as hydration, rest, and nutrition, to help manage your symptoms and promote recovery.\n3. **Investigating underlying conditions**: Identifying and addressing any underlying health issues that may be contributing to your prolonged recovery.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation. Keep them informed about your symptoms, and don't hesitate to seek medical attention if you experience any severe or worsening symptoms.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I wish you a full recovery from typhoid fever!",

Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. **Medical History:** The most straightforward way to determine if you've had chickenpox is by recalling your medical history. Chickenpox is highly contagious and common in childhood, so many people remember having it or their parents recall that they had it. If you're unsure, you can also ask family members or check old medical records.\n\n2. **Blood Test:** If you're still unsure, a blood test can help determine if you've had chickenpox. The test looks for the presence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies in your blood, which would indicate that you've been infected with the virus at some point in your life. There are two types of antibodies:\n   - **IgM antibodies:** These are present during the acute phase of the infection and typically indicate a current or recent infection.\n   - **IgG antibodies:** These develop after the infection has resolved and provide long-term immunity. The presence of IgG antibodies against VZV in your blood indicates that you have had chickenpox in the past or have been vaccinated against it.\n\n**Interpreting Test Results:**\n- **Positive for IgG antibodies:** This result means you have had chickenpox in the past or have been vaccinated, and you are immune.\n- **Negative for both IgG and IgM antibodies:** This result indicates that you have not had chickenpox and are not immune.\n- **Presence of IgM antibodies:** This suggests a current or recent infection.\n\n**Regarding the Shingles Vaccine (Zostavax or Shingrix):**\n- If you've had chickenpox, you're at risk for developing shingles, a painful rash that occurs when the varicella-zoster virus reactivates.\n- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get the shingles vaccine, even if they're not sure if they've had chickenpox. This is because almost all adults have had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it.\n- If you haven't had chickenpox, you should get vaccinated against chickenpox (varicella vaccine) instead of the shingles vaccine.\n\n**Important Note:** The newer shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is preferred over Zostavax because it provides stronger protection against shingles and its complications. Your healthcare provider can advise you on the best course of action based on your specific situation, including whether or not you should receive the shingles vaccine and which one is appropriate for you.",

This is because almost all adults have had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it.\n- If you haven't had chickenpox, you should get vaccinated against chickenpox (varicella vaccine) instead of the shingles vaccine.\n\n**Important Note:** The newer shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is preferred over Zostavax because it provides stronger protection against shingles and its complications. Your healthcare provider can advise you on the best course of action based on your specific situation, including whether or not you should receive the shingles vaccine and which one is appropriate for you.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nChickenpox (Exams and Tests): Your health care provider can most often diagnose chickenpox by looking at the rash and asking questions about the person's medical history.

[2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4]\u00a0 CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina. This can cause vision loss on its own. If CNV does develop, anti-VEGF therapy such as Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab can control and even reverse the CNV. However anti-VEGF therapy does not stop or reverse the vision loss caused by adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, only the extra vision loss that is due to also developing CNV. [2]\u00a0 Although vision loss is usually slow, when vision is impaired significantly, people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy may be referred for low vision testing and rehabilitation. Low vision rehabilitation can help maintain and optimize reading ability and improve overall quality of life. [4] [5]"

              "text": "Williams syndrome: Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development. It is passed down in families (inherited). Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births. One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing - Developmental delay - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD) - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting - Inward bend of the small finger - Learning disorders - Mild to moderate intellectual disability - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music - Short, compared to the rest of the person's family - Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip - Prominent lips with an open mouth - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include: - Narrowing of some blood vessels - Farsightedness - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles - High blood pressure - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye Tests for Williams syndrome include: - Blood pressure check - Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test) - Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound - Kidney ultrasound There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms. It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice. The following organization provides additional information about Williams Syndrome: Williams Syndrome Association -- www.williams-syndrome.org About 75% of people with Williams syndrome have some intellectual disability. Most people will not live as long as normal due to the various medical issues and other possible complications. Most people require full-time caregivers and often live in supervised group homes. Complications may include: - Calcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problems - Death (in rare cases from anesthesia) - Heart failure due to narrowed blood vessels - Pain in the abdomen Many of the symptoms and signs of Williams syndrome may not be obvious at birth. Call your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome. There is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome. Prenatal testing is available for couples with a family history of Williams syndrome who wish to conceive.

It is passed down in families (inherited). Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births. One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing - Developmental delay - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD) - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting - Inward bend of the small finger - Learning disorders - Mild to moderate intellectual disability - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music - Short, compared to the rest of the person's family - Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip - Prominent lips with an open mouth - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include: - Narrowing of some blood vessels - Farsightedness - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles - High blood pressure - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye Tests for Williams syndrome include: - Blood pressure check - Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test) - Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound - Kidney ultrasound There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms. It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice. The following organization provides additional information about Williams Syndrome: Williams Syndrome Association -- www.williams-syndrome.org About 75% of people with Williams syndrome have some intellectual disability.

A comprehensive medical evaluation, including:\n\n1. **Medical history**: Reviewing the person's medical history to rule out other conditions.\n2. **Physical examination**: Checking for motor symptoms, such as tremors and rigidity.\n3. **Neurological examination**: Assessing cognitive function, including memory, attention, and language.\n4. **Imaging tests**: Using CT or MRI scans to rule out other conditions, such as strokes or tumors.\n5. **Blood tests**: To rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.\n\n**Treatment and Management:**\n\nWhile there is no cure for LBD, various treatments can help manage the symptoms:\n\n1. **Cholinesterase inhibitors**: Medications that can improve cognitive function and reduce hallucinations.\n2. **Antipsychotic medications**: To manage hallucinations and agitation, but with caution, as they can worsen motor symptoms.\n3. **Parkinson's medications**: To alleviate motor symptoms, such as tremors and rigidity.\n4. **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Counseling, cognitive stimulation, and support groups can help people with LBD and their caregivers.\n\n**Raising Awareness:**\n\nYou're right; LBD is often overshadowed by Alzheimer's disease, but it's essential to raise awareness about this condition to:\n\n1. **Improve diagnosis**: Encourage healthcare professionals to consider LBD in their differential diagnosis.\n2. **Enhance support**: Provide resources and support for people with LBD and their caregivers.\n3. **Promote research**: Encourage research into the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of LBD.\n\n**Resources:**\n\nFor more information and support, you can visit:\n\n1. **Lewy Body Dementia Association** (LBDA): A non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness and providing support for people with LBD and their caregivers.\n2. **Alzheimer's Association**: Although primarily focused on Alzheimer's disease, they also provide information and resources on LBD.\n3. **National Institute on Aging** (NIA): A trusted source of information on aging and age-related diseases, including LBD.\n\nBy sharing this information, we can help raise awareness about Lewy Body Dementia and provide support to those affected by this condition.",

              "text": "Cystic Fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis (SIS-tik fi-BRO-sis), or CF, is an inherited disease of the secretory (see-KREH-tor-ee) glands. Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the disease\u2014one from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves. CF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Overview Mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. If you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. These enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. If you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh). CF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.) Outlook The symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often. Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF. As treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. Early treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. Your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas Mucoviscidosis (MU-ko-vis-ih-DO-sis) Mucoviscidosis of the pancreas Pancreas fibrocystic disease Pancreatic cystic fibrosis A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. Research suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF. More than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. How Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited? Every person inherits two CFTR genes\u2014one from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF. Children who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. The image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. Example of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects both males and females and people from all racial and ethnic groups. However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent. CF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans. More than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers. The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body. Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF. People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage. As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis). Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. Digestive System Signs and Symptoms In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines. As a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as: Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain. Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. Diabetes. Gallstones. Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms Men who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis. Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications. Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia. Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests. Newborn Screening All States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly. Sweat Test If a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat. For this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling. Sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF. Other Tests If you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Genetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF. A chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air. A sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. A sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment. Prenatal Screening If you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). In amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal. In CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing People who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children. If you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier. A genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include: Preventing and controlling lung infections Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines Providing enough nutrition Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body) Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital. Specialists Involved If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF. Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers. The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. Treatment for Lung Problems The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Chest Physical Therapy CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up. You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs. Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as: An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor. An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up. A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus. A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls. Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways. Exercise Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition. However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood. If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first. Medicines If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older). Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital. Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral. Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms. Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. If other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include: Exercise training Nutritional counseling Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it Energy-conserving techniques Breathing strategies Psychological counseling and/or group support PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR. For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article. Treatment for Digestive Problems CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs. In addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include: Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins. Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb. High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients. A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising. A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep. Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes. Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density. If you or your child has cystic fibrosis (CF), you should learn as much as you can about the disease. Work closely with your doctors to learn how to manage CF. Ongoing Care Having ongoing medical care by a team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists who specialize in CF is important. These specialists often are located at major medical centers or CF Care Centers. The United States has more than 100 CF Care Centers. Most of these centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. It's standard to have CF checkups every 3 months. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get an annual flu shot and other vaccines. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. In between checkups, be sure to contact your doctor if you have: Blood in your mucus, increased amounts of mucus, or a change in the color or consistency of your mucus. Decreased energy or appetite. Severe constipation or diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or vomit that's dark green. A fever, which is a sign of infection. (However, you may still have a serious infection that needs treatment even if you don't have a fever.) Transition of Care Better treatments for CF allow people who have the disease to live longer now than in the past. Thus, the move from pediatric care to adult care is an important step in treatment. If your child has CF, encourage him or her to learn about the disease and take an active role in treatment. This will help prepare your child for the transition to adult care. CF Care Centers can help provide age-appropriate treatment throughout the transition period and into adulthood. They also will support the transition to adult care by balancing medical needs with other developmental factors, such as increased independence, relationships, and employment. Talk with your child's health care team for more information about how to help your child move from pediatric care to adult care. Lifestyle Changes In between medical checkups, you can practice good self-care and follow a healthy lifestyle. For example, follow a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of foods you should include in your diet. Other lifestyle changes include: Not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke Washing your hands often to lower your risk of infection Exercising regularly and drinking lots of fluids Doing chest physical therapy (as your doctor recommends) Other Concerns Although CF requires daily care, most people who have the disease are able to attend school and work. Adults who have CF can expect to have normal sex lives. Most men who have the disease are infertile (unable to have children). However, modern fertility treatments may help them. Women who have CF may find it hard to get pregnant, but they usually can have children. If you have CF, you should talk with your doctor if you're planning a pregnancy. Although CF can cause fertility problems, men and women who have the disease should still have protected sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Emotional Issues Living with CF may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with CF. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you."

Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the disease\u2014one from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves. CF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Overview Mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. If you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. These enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. If you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh). CF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.) Outlook The symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often. Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF. As treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. Early treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. Your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas Mucoviscidosis (MU-ko-vis-ih-DO-sis) Mucoviscidosis of the pancreas Pancreas fibrocystic disease Pancreatic cystic fibrosis A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. Research suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF. More than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. How Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited? Every person inherits two CFTR genes\u2014one from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF. Children who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. The image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. Example of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects both males and females and people from all racial and ethnic groups. However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent. CF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans. More than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers. The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body. Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF. People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage. As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis). Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. Digestive System Signs and Symptoms In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines. As a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as: Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain. Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. Diabetes. Gallstones. Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms Men who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis. Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications. Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia. Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests. Newborn Screening All States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly. Sweat Test If a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat. For this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling. Sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF. Other Tests If you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Genetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF. A chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air. A sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. A sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment. Prenatal Screening If you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). In amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal. In CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing People who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children. If you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier. A genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include: Preventing and controlling lung infections Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines Providing enough nutrition Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body) Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital. Specialists Involved If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF. Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers. The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. Treatment for Lung Problems The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Chest Physical Therapy CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up. You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs. Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as: An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor. An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up. A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus. A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls. Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways. Exercise Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition. However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood. If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first. Medicines If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older). Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital. Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral. Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms. Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. If other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include: Exercise training Nutritional counseling Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it Energy-conserving techniques Breathing strategies Psychological counseling and/or group support PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR. For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article. Treatment for Digestive Problems CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs. In addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include: Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins. Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb. High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients. A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising. A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep. Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes. Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density. If you or your child has cystic fibrosis (CF), you should learn as much as you can about the disease. Work closely with your doctors to learn how to manage CF. Ongoing Care Having ongoing medical care by a team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists who specialize in CF is important. These specialists often are located at major medical centers or CF Care Centers. The United States has more than 100 CF Care Centers. Most of these centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. It's standard to have CF checkups every 3 months. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get an annual flu shot and other vaccines. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. In between checkups, be sure to contact your doctor if you have: Blood in your mucus, increased amounts of mucus, or a change in the color or consistency of your mucus. Decreased energy or appetite. Severe constipation or diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or vomit that's dark green. A fever, which is a sign of infection. (However, you may still have a serious infection that needs treatment even if you don't have a fever.) Transition of Care Better treatments for CF allow people who have the disease to live longer now than in the past. Thus, the move from pediatric care to adult care is an important step in treatment. If your child has CF, encourage him or her to learn about the disease and take an active role in treatment. This will help prepare your child for the transition to adult care. CF Care Centers can help provide age-appropriate treatment throughout the transition period and into adulthood. They also will support the transition to adult care by balancing medical needs with other developmental factors, such as increased independence, relationships, and employment. Talk with your child's health care team for more information about how to help your child move from pediatric care to adult care. Lifestyle Changes In between medical checkups, you can practice good self-care and follow a healthy lifestyle. For example, follow a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of foods you should include in your diet. Other lifestyle changes include: Not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke Washing your hands often to lower your risk of infection Exercising regularly and drinking lots of fluids Doing chest physical therapy (as your doctor recommends) Other Concerns Although CF requires daily care, most people who have the disease are able to attend school and work. Adults who have CF can expect to have normal sex lives. Most men who have the disease are infertile (unable to have children). However, modern fertility treatments may help them. Women who have CF may find it hard to get pregnant, but they usually can have children. If you have CF, you should talk with your doctor if you're planning a pregnancy. Although CF can cause fertility problems, men and women who have the disease should still have protected sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Emotional Issues Living with CF may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with CF. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety.

The NICHD supports and conducts research on the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and inheritance of Fragile X and its associated conditions, Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). All three conditions result from changes in the same gene on the X chromosome.\u00a0 What is Fragile X syndrome? Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a person\u2019s development, especially that person\u2019s behavior and ability to learn. In addition, Fragile X can affect: - Communication skills - Physical appearance - Sensitivity to noise, light, or other sensory information Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) People with Fragile X syndrome may not have noticeable symptoms, or they can have more serious symptoms that range from learning disabilities to cognitive and behavior problems. How is FMR1 mutation related? \u00bb Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by changes (mutations) in the FMR1 gene found on the X chromosome. This mutation affects how the body makes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which can cause the symptoms of Fragile X. In a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps to start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene includes many repeats\u2014repeated instances of a specific DNA sequence called the CGG sequence. A normal FMR1 gene has between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. People with between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation of the gene. The premutation may cause the gene to not work properly, but it does not cause intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The premutation is linked to the disorders FXPOI and FXTAS. However, not all people with the premutation show symptoms of FXPOI or FXTAS. People with 200 or more repeats in the promoter part of the gene have a full mutation, meaning the gene might not work at all. People with a full mutation often have Fragile X syndrome. The number of repeats, also called the \u201csize of the mutation,\u201d affects the type of symptoms and how serious the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome will be. Inheriting Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to children. Anyone with the FMR1 gene mutation can pass it to their children. However, a person who inherits the gene mutation may not develop Fragile X syndrome. Males will pass it down to all of their daughters and not their sons. Females have a 50/50 chance to pass it along to both their sons and daughters. In some cases, an FMR1 premutation can change to a full mutation when it is passed from parent to child. Read more about how FMR1 changes as it is passed from parent to child. \u00ab\u00a0 Condition Information What causes it?\u00a0\u00bb Fragile X results from a change or mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which is found on the X chromosome. The gene normally makes a protein called Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. This protein is important for creating and maintaining connections between cells in the brain and nervous system. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which often causes the symptoms of Fragile X. Not everyone with the mutated FMR1 gene has symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, because the body may still be able to make FMRP. A few things affect how much FMRP the body can make: - The size of the mutation. Some people have a smaller mutation (a lower number of repeats) in their FMR1 gene, while others have big mutations (a large number of repeats) in the gene. If the mutation is small, the body may be able to make some of the protein. Having the protein available makes the symptoms milder. - The number of cells that have the mutation. Because not every cell in the body is exactly the same, some cells might have the FMR1 mutation while others do not. This situation is called mosaicism (pronounced moh-ZAY-uh-siz-uhm). If the mutation is in most of the body\u2019s cells, the person will probably have symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. If the mutation is in only some of the cells, the person might not have any symptoms at all or only mild symptoms. - Being female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have only one. In females, if the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome has the mutation, the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome might not have the mutation. Even if one of the female\u2019s genes has a very large mutation, the body can usually make at least some FMRP, leading to milder symptoms. \u00ab\u00a0 How is FMR1 mutation related? How many people are affected?\u00a0\u00bb About 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females have Fragile X syndrome. How many people have the Fragile X premutation? Although Fragile X syndrome is relatively rare, premutations in the FMR1 gene are relatively common: A recent study of 6,747 people found that 1 in 151 women and 1 in 468 men had the premutation. People with the premutation might not have any symptoms of Fragile X. However, the premutation can sometimes expand in the next generation, which can cause Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What causes it? What are common symptoms\u00a0\u00bb People with Fragile X do not all have the same signs and symptoms, but they do have some things in common. Symptoms are often milder in females than in males. - Intelligence and learning. Many people with Fragile X have problems with intellectual functioning. - These problems can range from the mild, such as learning disorders or problems with mathematics, to the severe, such as an intellectual or developmental disability. - The syndrome may affect the ability to think, reason, and learn. - Because many people with Fragile X also have attention disorders, hyperactivity, anxiety, and language-processing problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score suggests. - Physical. Most infants and younger children with Fragile X don\u2019t have any specific physical features of this syndrome. When these children start to go through puberty, however, many will begin to develop certain features that are typical of those with Fragile X. - These features include a narrow face, large head, large ears, flexible joints, flat feet, and a prominent forehead. - These physical signs become more obvious with age. - Behavioral, social, and emotional. Most children with Fragile X have some behavioral challenges. - They may be afraid or anxious in new situations. - They may have trouble making eye contact with other people. - Boys, especially, may have trouble paying attention or be aggressive. - Girls may be shy around new people. They may also have attention disorders and problems with hyperactivity. - Speech and language. Most boys with Fragile X have some problems with speech and language. - They may have trouble speaking clearly, may stutter, or may leave out parts of words. They may also have problems understanding other people\u2019s social cues, such as tone of voice or specific types of body language. - Girls usually do not have severe problems with speech or language. - Some children with Fragile X begin talking later than typically developing children. Most will talk eventually, but a few might stay nonverbal throughout their lives. - Sensory. Many children with Fragile X are bothered by certain sensations, such as bright light, loud noises, or the way certain clothing feels on their bodies. - These sensory issues might cause them to act out or display behavior problems. \u00ab\u00a0 How many people are affected? How is it diagnosed?\u00a0\u00bb Health care providers often use a blood sample to diagnose Fragile X. The health care provider will take a sample of blood and will send it to a laboratory, which will determine what form of the FMR1 gene is present. Prenatal Testing (During Pregnancy) Pregnant women who have an FMR1 premutation or full mutation may pass that mutated gene on to their children. A prenatal test allows health care providers to detect the mutated gene in the developing fetus. This important information helps families and providers to prepare for Fragile X syndrome and to intervene as early as possible. Possible types of prenatal tests include: - Amniocentesis (pronounced am-nee-oh-sen-TEE-sis). A health care provider takes a sample of amniotic (pronounced am-nee-OT-ik) fluid, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. - Chorionic villus (pronounced KOHR-ee-on-ik VILL-uhs) sampling. A health care provider takes a sample of cells from the placenta, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. Because prenatal testing involves some risk to the mother and fetus, if you or a family member is considering prenatal testing for Fragile X, discuss all the risks and benefits with your health care provider. Prenatal testing is not very common, and many parents do not know they carry the mutation. Therefore, parents usually start to notice symptoms in their children when they are infants or toddlers. The average age at diagnosis is 36 months for boys and 42 months for girls. Diagnosis of Children Many parents first notice symptoms of delayed development in their infants or toddlers. These symptoms may include delays in speech and language skills, social and emotional difficulties, and being sensitive to certain sensations. Children may also be delayed in or have problems with motor skills such as learning to walk. A health care provider can perform developmental screening to determine the nature of delays in a child. If a health care provider suspects the child has Fragile X syndrome, he/she can refer parents to a clinical geneticist, who can perform a genetic test for Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What are common symptoms? What are the treatments?\u00a0\u00bb \u200b\u200b There is no single treatment for Fragile X syndrome, but there are treatments that help minimize the symptoms of the condition. Individuals with Fragile X who receive appropriate education, therapy services, and medications have the best chance of using all of their individual capabilities and skills. Even those with an intellectual or developmental disability can learn to master many self-help skills. Early intervention is important. Because a young child\u2019s brain is still forming, early intervention gives children the best start possible and the greatest chance of developing a full range of skills. The sooner a child with Fragile X syndrome gets treatment, the more opportunity there is for learning. \u00ab How is it diagnosed? Educational treatments \u00bb Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? Among the other conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome are the following: - Autism spectrum disorder. From 30% to 50% of people with Fragile X also meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. - Mitral valve prolapse. In mitral valve prolapse (pronounced MY-truhl valv PROH-laps), a heart condition, the valve that separates the upper and lower left chambers of the heart does not work properly. This condition is usually not life-threatening, but in severe cases, surgery might be required to correct the problem. - Seizures. Between 6% and 20% of children with Fragile X syndrome have seizures. Seizures associated with the syndrome are more common in boys than in girls. [top] How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? The gene for Fragile X is carried on the X chromosome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children. - A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will pass that gene on only to his daughters. To his sons he will pass on a Y chromosome, which doesn\u2019t transmit Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, a father with the altered gene on his X chromosome and a mother with normal X chromosomes would have daughters with the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene. - A father can pass on the premutation form of the FMR1 gene to his daughters but not the full mutation. Even if the father himself has a full mutation of this gene, it appears that sperm can carry only the premutation. Scientists don\u2019t understand how or why fathers can pass on only the milder form of Fragile X to their daughters. This remains an area of focused research. - Mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, so if a mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If a mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene. - These 50-50 odds apply for each child the parents have. Having one child with the FMR1 mutation does not increase or decrease the chances of having another child with the mutated FMR1 gene. This is also true for the severity of the symptoms. Having one child with mild symptoms does not mean that the other children will have severe symptoms, and having a child with severe symptoms does not mean that the other children will have mild symptoms. [top] How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? The repeats in the promoter part of the FMR1 gene are unstable, and sometimes the number of repeats increases from one generation to the next. A premutation gene is less stable than a full mutation gene. So as it passes from parent to child, a premutation gene might expand to become a full mutation gene. The chances of expansion depend on the number of repeats in the promoter of the premutation gene: Normal FMR1 genes that have 5 to 44 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered normal. When these genes are passed from parent to child, the number of repeats does not increase or decrease. Intermediate FMR1 genes with 45 to 54 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered intermediate, or borderline. An intermediate gene may expand from one generation to the next, depending on which parent has the gene. Mother to Child About 14% of the time, when a mother passes an intermediate gene to her child, the CGG repeats increase to a number seen with premutations. Research shows that an intermediate gene will not become a full mutation gene in one generation, and so a mother with an intermediate gene will not have a child with a full mutation. Father to Child When intermediate genes are transmitted from father to child, they are generally stable and do not increase to premutations. Premutations Premutation (55 to 199 CGG repeats) FMR1 genes can expand to a full mutation from one generation to the next. The risk of expansion depends on which parent has the gene and the number of repeats in that gene. Mother to Child An FMR1 gene from the mother with 100 CGG repeats is very likely to expand to a full mutation when passed to the child. An FMR1 gene from the mother with 70 to 79 CGG repeats has about a 30% chance of expanding to a full mutation in one generation. Father to Child Premutations passed from father to child have almost no chance of expanding to full mutations. [top] \u00ab What are the Treatments?"

The NICHD supports and conducts research on the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and inheritance of Fragile X and its associated conditions, Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). All three conditions result from changes in the same gene on the X chromosome.\u00a0 What is Fragile X syndrome? Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a person\u2019s development, especially that person\u2019s behavior and ability to learn. In addition, Fragile X can affect: - Communication skills - Physical appearance - Sensitivity to noise, light, or other sensory information Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) People with Fragile X syndrome may not have noticeable symptoms, or they can have more serious symptoms that range from learning disabilities to cognitive and behavior problems. How is FMR1 mutation related? \u00bb Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by changes (mutations) in the FMR1 gene found on the X chromosome. This mutation affects how the body makes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which can cause the symptoms of Fragile X. In a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps to start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene includes many repeats\u2014repeated instances of a specific DNA sequence called the CGG sequence. A normal FMR1 gene has between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. People with between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation of the gene. The premutation may cause the gene to not work properly, but it does not cause intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The premutation is linked to the disorders FXPOI and FXTAS. However, not all people with the premutation show symptoms of FXPOI or FXTAS. People with 200 or more repeats in the promoter part of the gene have a full mutation, meaning the gene might not work at all. People with a full mutation often have Fragile X syndrome. The number of repeats, also called the \u201csize of the mutation,\u201d affects the type of symptoms and how serious the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome will be. Inheriting Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to children. Anyone with the FMR1 gene mutation can pass it to their children. However, a person who inherits the gene mutation may not develop Fragile X syndrome. Males will pass it down to all of their daughters and not their sons. Females have a 50/50 chance to pass it along to both their sons and daughters. In some cases, an FMR1 premutation can change to a full mutation when it is passed from parent to child. Read more about how FMR1 changes as it is passed from parent to child. \u00ab\u00a0 Condition Information What causes it?\u00a0\u00bb Fragile X results from a change or mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which is found on the X chromosome. The gene normally makes a protein called Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. This protein is important for creating and maintaining connections between cells in the brain and nervous system. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which often causes the symptoms of Fragile X. Not everyone with the mutated FMR1 gene has symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, because the body may still be able to make FMRP. A few things affect how much FMRP the body can make: - The size of the mutation. Some people have a smaller mutation (a lower number of repeats) in their FMR1 gene, while others have big mutations (a large number of repeats) in the gene. If the mutation is small, the body may be able to make some of the protein. Having the protein available makes the symptoms milder. - The number of cells that have the mutation. Because not every cell in the body is exactly the same, some cells might have the FMR1 mutation while others do not. This situation is called mosaicism (pronounced moh-ZAY-uh-siz-uhm). If the mutation is in most of the body\u2019s cells, the person will probably have symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. If the mutation is in only some of the cells, the person might not have any symptoms at all or only mild symptoms. - Being female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have only one. In females, if the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome has the mutation, the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome might not have the mutation. Even if one of the female\u2019s genes has a very large mutation, the body can usually make at least some FMRP, leading to milder symptoms. \u00ab\u00a0 How is FMR1 mutation related?

Symptoms are often milder in females than in males. - Intelligence and learning. Many people with Fragile X have problems with intellectual functioning. - These problems can range from the mild, such as learning disorders or problems with mathematics, to the severe, such as an intellectual or developmental disability. - The syndrome may affect the ability to think, reason, and learn. - Because many people with Fragile X also have attention disorders, hyperactivity, anxiety, and language-processing problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score suggests. - Physical. Most infants and younger children with Fragile X don\u2019t have any specific physical features of this syndrome.

They may also have attention disorders and problems with hyperactivity. - Speech and language. Most boys with Fragile X have some problems with speech and language. - They may have trouble speaking clearly, may stutter, or may leave out parts of words. They may also have problems understanding other people\u2019s social cues, such as tone of voice or specific types of body language. - Girls usually do not have severe problems with speech or language. - Some children with Fragile X begin talking later than typically developing children. Most will talk eventually, but a few might stay nonverbal throughout their lives. - Sensory. Many children with Fragile X are bothered by certain sensations, such as bright light, loud noises, or the way certain clothing feels on their bodies. - These sensory issues might cause them to act out or display behavior problems. \u00ab\u00a0 How many people are affected?

An intermediate gene may expand from one generation to the next, depending on which parent has the gene. Mother to Child About 14% of the time, when a mother passes an intermediate gene to her child, the CGG repeats increase to a number seen with premutations. Research shows that an intermediate gene will not become a full mutation gene in one generation, and so a mother with an intermediate gene will not have a child with a full mutation. Father to Child When intermediate genes are transmitted from father to child, they are generally stable and do not increase to premutations. Premutations Premutation (55 to 199 CGG repeats) FMR1 genes can expand to a full mutation from one generation to the next. The risk of expansion depends on which parent has the gene and the number of repeats in that gene. Mother to Child An FMR1 gene from the mother with 100 CGG repeats is very likely to expand to a full mutation when passed to the child. An FMR1 gene from the mother with 70 to 79 CGG repeats has about a 30% chance of expanding to a full mutation in one generation. Father to Child Premutations passed from father to child have almost no chance of expanding to full mutations.

However, research has identified several lifestyle changes and interventions that may help reduce the risk of developing dementia. Here are some steps you can take to promote brain health and potentially lower your risk:\n\n1. **Stay physically active**: Regular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, most days of the week.\n2. **Maintain a healthy diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources. The Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, has been associated with a lower risk of dementia.\n3. **Stay mentally active**: Engage in mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, puzzles, and learning new skills, to challenge your brain and build cognitive reserve.\n4. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night, as sleep plays an important role in brain health and cognitive function.\n5. **Manage stress**: Chronic stress can have negative effects on the brain, so engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n6. **Stay socially connected**: Maintaining social connections and building strong relationships with friends and family can help support cognitive health.\n7. **Monitor and manage health conditions**: Certain health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, can increase the risk of dementia. Work with your healthcare provider to manage these conditions and reduce your risk.\n8. **Don't smoke**: Smoking has been linked to an increased risk of dementia, so quitting smoking or avoiding it altogether can help reduce your risk.\n9. **Limit alcohol consumption**: Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of dementia, so limit your intake to moderate levels (up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men).\n10. **Get enough vitamin D**: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of dementia, so ensure you're getting enough through sun exposure, supplements, or fortified foods.\n11. **Stay up-to-date on vaccinations**: Certain vaccinations, such as the flu vaccine, can help reduce the risk of dementia by preventing infections that can affect the brain.\n12. **Consider cognitive training**: Engage in cognitive training programs or activities that challenge your brain and build cognitive reserve, such as cognitive therapy or brain games.\n\nIt's essential to note that while these lifestyle changes may help reduce the risk of dementia, they may not completely prevent the condition. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, cannot be changed.\n\nAdditionally, if you're concerned about your risk of dementia or are experiencing memory or cognitive problems, consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and guidance.

In some cases, it can also lead to a condition known as \"dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome,\" which includes symptoms like depression, anxiety, and fatigue, among others.\n\n3. **Gradual tapering**: To minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms, your doctor may recommend a gradual tapering of the dosage. This involves slowly reducing the dose of rasagiline over a period of time. The exact schedule for tapering will depend on your individual response and the dosage you're currently taking.\n\n4. **Monitoring**: During the tapering process, it's essential to monitor your Parkinson's symptoms and any potential side effects closely. Keep a diary or use an app to track your symptoms, which can help your doctor adjust the tapering schedule as needed.\n\n5. **Alternative treatments**: Your doctor may discuss alternative treatments with you. This could involve switching to a different medication or adjusting your current treatment regimen to manage your Parkinson's symptoms effectively.\n\n6. **Follow-up appointments**: Regular follow-up appointments with your doctor are vital during and after the tapering process. These appointments will help your healthcare provider assess how you're responding to the changes in your medication and make any necessary adjustments.\n\n7. **Support**: Stopping a medication can be challenging, both physically and emotionally. Consider reaching out to support groups or counseling services for help in coping with any difficulties you might encounter during this process.\n\nRemember, the decision to stop taking rasagiline should always be made in consultation with a healthcare provider. They can provide personalized guidance and support to ensure your safety and the best possible management of your Parkinson's disease symptoms.",

It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take rasagiline at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rasagiline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of rasagiline and may increase your dose based upon your body's response to this medication. Do not stop taking rasagiline without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking rasagiline, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as a fever; muscle stiffness; unsteadiness, wobbliness, or lack of coordination; or changes in consciousness. Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms when your dose of rasagiline is decreased.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Diabetes (Causes): Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both. To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease."

It's a complex condition, and there are several factors that can contribute to its development. Here's a detailed explanation of how people get diabetes:\n\n**Types of Diabetes**\n\nThere are three main types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes.\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: This type of diabetes is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and it's not preventable.\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: This is the most common type of diabetes, and it's often associated with lifestyle factors and genetics. With Type 2 diabetes, the body either resists the effects of insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood sugar level.\n3. **Gestational Diabetes**: This type of diabetes develops during pregnancy, usually in the second or third trimester, and is thought to be caused by hormonal changes and insulin resistance.\n\n**Risk Factors for Developing Diabetes**\n\nSeveral risk factors can increase your chances of developing diabetes. These include:\n\n* **Family History**: Having a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with diabetes increases your risk.\n* **Age**: Your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after 45.\n* **Obesity**: Being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor for Type 2 diabetes.\n* **Physical Inactivity**: A sedentary lifestyle can contribute to insulin resistance and increase your risk.\n* **Poor Diet**: Consuming a diet high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats can increase your risk.\n* **High Blood Pressure**: Having high blood pressure can increase your risk of developing diabetes.\n* **History of Gestational Diabetes**: If you've had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, you're at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.\n* **Ethnicity**: Certain ethnic groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and American Indians, are at higher risk of developing diabetes.\n\n**How People Get Diabetes**\n\nPeople can get diabetes through a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. For example:\n\n* **Insulin Resistance**: When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which is then absorbed into your bloodstream. Insulin helps your cells absorb glucose for energy. However, if you're insulin resistant, your cells don't respond well to insulin, and your pancreas produces more insulin to compensate. Over time, your pancreas can't keep up with the demand, and your blood sugar levels rise.\n* **Pancreatic Damage**: Certain medications, such as steroids, and medical conditions, like pancreatitis, can damage the pancreas and reduce its ability to produce insulin.\n* **Hormonal Imbalance**: Hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to gestational diabetes.\n\n**Prevention and Management**\n\nWhile some risk factors, like family history and age, can't be changed, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing diabetes:\n\n* **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Losing weight, if you're overweight or obese, can help you prevent or manage diabetes.\n* **Exercise Regularly**: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week.\n* **Eat a Balanced Diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n* **Monitor Your Blood Sugar Levels**: If you're at high risk of developing diabetes, work with your healthcare provider to monitor your blood sugar levels and develop a plan to prevent or manage the condition.\n\nRemember, early detection and treatment can help you manage diabetes and prevent complications. If you're concerned about your risk of developing diabetes, talk to your healthcare provider about your individual risk factors and develop a plan to reduce your risk.",

Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The treatment plan may vary depending on the severity of the burn, which can range from mild erythema (redness) to more severe effects such as ulceration and necrosis. Here are steps and considerations for treating radiation burns:\n\n1. **Assessment**: The first step is a thorough assessment of the burn by a healthcare professional. This evaluation determines the severity of the radiation burn, which guides the treatment plan. The assessment considers the dose of radiation received, the area of the body affected, and the depth of the burn.\n\n2. **Wound Care**: Basic wound care principles apply, including keeping the burn clean and covered to prevent infection. Topical creams or gels, such as silver sulfadiazine, may be prescribed to aid in healing and prevent infection. In some cases, debridement (removal of dead tissue) may be necessary to promote healing.\n\n3. **Pain Management**: Radiation burns can be quite painful. Pain management strategies may include topical anesthetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or in severe cases, narcotics.\n\n4. **Prevention of Infection**: Since radiation can impair the skin\u2019s natural barrier function, preventing infection is crucial. This may involve applying topical antibiotics and, in some cases, using oral antibiotics if an infection develops.\n\n5. **Moisturizing**: Keeping the affected skin moisturized is important. Topical creams and ointments that are fragrance-free and hypoallergenic can help soothe and protect the skin.\n\n6. **Avoiding Further Irritation**: Avoiding further irritation to the affected area is essential. This includes avoiding direct sunlight, not using harsh soaps, and avoiding tight clothing that may rub against the burn.\n\n7. **Nutritional Support**: Adequate nutrition is crucial for healing. A diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins can support the healing process.\n\n8. **Consulting a Specialist**: In severe cases, or if the burn does not show signs of healing, consulting a specialist such as a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon may be necessary. These specialists can provide advanced treatments such as skin grafts if needed.\n\n9. **Follow-Up Care**: Regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider are important to monitor the healing process and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.\n\nIt's important to note that while these treatments can help manage symptoms and promote healing, they cannot remove the radiation or reverse all the damage caused by radiation exposure. Prevention, through protective measures during radiation therapy or other radiation exposure, is key. If you suspect you have a radiation burn, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly to prevent complications and promote the best possible outcomes.",

            "text": "Lanreotide is a medication used to treat certain medical conditions, including acromegaly and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). It belongs to a class of medications known as somatostatin analogs, which work by imitating the action of a natural hormone in the body to slow down the production of other hormones.\n\nThe administration of lanreotide typically involves injecting the medication under the skin (subcutaneously) using a pre-filled syringe or an prolonged-release formulation that is injected deep into the buttock muscle (gluteal muscle) every 28 days. However, the most common formulation for lanreotide is the prolonged-release (or depot) formulation, which allows for less frequent dosing compared to the regular formulation.\n\nHere are the steps for administering lanreotide injections, which should be performed by a healthcare professional or a person who has been trained in the proper injection technique:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Before administering the injection, ensure that the medication has been stored properly in the refrigerator at a temperature between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). Allow the syringe to reach room temperature before injection.\n\n2. **Choosing the Injection Site**: The injection site should be alternated between the two gluteal regions to minimize the risk of lipodystrophy (abnormal distribution of body fat).\n\n3. **Administering the Injection**: The injection should be given slowly over 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on the formulation being used.\n\n4. **Post-Injection Care**: After the injection, apply gentle pressure to the injection site without rubbing. Monitor the injection site for any signs of local reaction.\n\nIt's crucial to follow the specific administration instructions provided by your healthcare provider or the instructions that come with your lanreotide product. If you are administering lanreotide or receiving it from someone else, ensure that you understand the proper technique and any precautions that need to be taken.\n\nAdditionally, lanreotide injections should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Regular monitoring may be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and to watch for potential side effects. Common side effects of lanreotide include gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea, as well as injection site reactions.

It belongs to a class of medications known as somatostatin analogs, which work by imitating the action of a natural hormone in the body to slow down the production of other hormones.\n\nThe administration of lanreotide typically involves injecting the medication under the skin (subcutaneously) using a pre-filled syringe or an prolonged-release formulation that is injected deep into the buttock muscle (gluteal muscle) every 28 days. However, the most common formulation for lanreotide is the prolonged-release (or depot) formulation, which allows for less frequent dosing compared to the regular formulation.\n\nHere are the steps for administering lanreotide injections, which should be performed by a healthcare professional or a person who has been trained in the proper injection technique:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Before administering the injection, ensure that the medication has been stored properly in the refrigerator at a temperature between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). Allow the syringe to reach room temperature before injection.\n\n2. **Choosing the Injection Site**: The injection site should be alternated between the two gluteal regions to minimize the risk of lipodystrophy (abnormal distribution of body fat).\n\n3. **Administering the Injection**: The injection should be given slowly over 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on the formulation being used.\n\n4. **Post-Injection Care**: After the injection, apply gentle pressure to the injection site without rubbing.

Viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis, but the condition can also be caused by other infections, heavy alcohol use, toxins, certain medications, and autoimmune disease. There are five main virus types that cause hepatitis---type A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingesting contaminated food or water. Type B commonly occurs through contact with infected blood, semen or other bodily fluid through sex, sharing needles or other drug-injection equipment or from mother to baby at birth. Hepatitis type C is a blood-borne virus that is largely spread by sharing needles or other drug injection equipment. Hepatitis D, which is transmitted through contact with infectious blood, occurs only among people with hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B, C, and D afflict more than half a billion people worldwide and are responsible for more than a million deaths a year. Chronic infection with these viruses can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. The NIAID Hepatitis Research Program supports research on all hepatitis viruses. However, commensurate with the magnitude of the medical burdens imposed by these viruses, the greatest emphasis is placed on the study of hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses, which focuses on the understanding the pathogenesis and immunology of hepatitis viruses and developing novel therapeutics and vaccines against diseases caused by hepatitis viruses. Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver. Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements Stomach pain Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer. Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent some viral forms."

            "text": "To check for lupus, a combination of physical examinations, medical history, laboratory tests, and sometimes imaging studies are used. Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, and other organs, making its diagnosis somewhat complex. Here's a step-by-step guide on how lupus is typically diagnosed:\n\n1. **Medical History and Physical Examination**: The first step in diagnosing lupus involves a thorough medical history and physical examination. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, medical history, and the history of your family members to identify any patterns that might suggest lupus. A physical examination can help identify signs of the disease, such as skin rashes, joint swelling, or other abnormalities.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests**: Several laboratory tests can help diagnose lupus or rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. These tests include:\n   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for low red blood cell count (anemia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), or low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).\n   - **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) or C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**: These tests measure inflammation levels in the body.\n   - **Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) Test**: This is a key test for lupus. A positive result can indicate lupus, but it's also positive in other autoimmune diseases and in some healthy individuals. Almost all people with lupus test positive for ANA.\n   - **Anti-dsDNA and Anti-Sm Antibodies**: These are specific types of antibodies more commonly found in people with lupus.\n   - **Complement Tests**: To measure the levels of complement, a group of proteins in the blood that help fight off infections. Low complement levels can indicate lupus.\n   - **Urinalysis**: To check for signs of kidney damage, such as protein or blood in the urine.\n\n3. **Imaging Tests**: Depending on which parts of the body are affected, imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, or echocardiograms may be ordered to examine the lungs, heart, or other organs.\n\n4. **Biopsy**: In some cases, a biopsy (removing a small sample of tissue) of the skin or kidney may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy can show whether there is inflammation or damage characteristic of lupus.\n\n**Criteria for Diagnosis**: To be diagnosed with lupus, a person must meet at least 4 of 11 criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology. These criteria include symptoms such as:\n- Malar rash (butterfly-shaped rash across the cheeks)\n- Discoid rash\n- Photosensitivity\n- Oral ulcers\n- Arthritis (in two or more joints)\n- Serositis (inflammation of the lining around the lungs or heart)\n- Kidney disorder (persistent protein or casts in urine)\n- Neurological disorder (seizures or psychosis)\n- Hematologic disorder (low red or white blood cell count or platelets)\n- Positive ANA test\n- Immunological disorder (presence of certain antibodies)\n\nLupus can be challenging to diagnose because its symptoms can be similar to those of other diseases, and no single test can definitively diagnose it. A rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in autoimmune diseases, is often involved in the diagnosis and treatment of lupus.",

            "text": "Diagnosing anxiety involves a combination of physical and psychological evaluations. Here's a step-by-step guide on how anxiety is typically diagnosed:\n\n1. **Physical Exam and Medical History**: A healthcare provider will start by conducting a physical exam and taking a thorough medical history. This is to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be causing or contributing to the symptoms of anxiety, such as thyroid disorders, heart disease, or substance abuse.\n\n2. **Psychological Evaluation**: The healthcare provider will then perform a psychological evaluation. This can involve talking to the patient about their symptoms, including when they started, how long they last, and any factors that make them better or worse. The patient may be asked to fill out a questionnaire or rating scale to help assess the severity of their anxiety.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Criteria**: Mental health professionals use specific diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose anxiety disorders. There are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and phobias, each with its own set of diagnostic criteria.\n\n4. **Assessment Tools**: Various assessment tools and questionnaires may be used to help diagnose anxiety and assess its severity. Common tools include the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression (since depression often co-occurs with anxiety), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A).\n\n5. **Mental Health Professional Evaluation**: A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, may conduct a more detailed evaluation. This can involve an in-depth interview and possibly additional psychological tests to understand the patient's thought patterns, feelings, and behaviors.\n\n6. ** Differential Diagnosis**: It's crucial to differentiate anxiety from other mental health conditions that may present with similar symptoms, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\n7. **Treatment Planning**: Once a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder is made, the healthcare provider will work with the patient to develop a treatment plan. This plan may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), medication (like antidepressants or benzodiazepines), lifestyle changes (including exercise, mindfulness, and stress management), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nIt's essential for individuals experiencing symptoms of anxiety to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Voluntary muscles are the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. Your nerve cells, also called neurons, send the messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die, communication between your nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result, your muscles weaken and waste away. The weakness can lead to twitching, cramps, aches and pains, and joint and movement problems. Sometimes it also affects heart function and your ability to breathe. Examples of neuromuscular disorders include - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Spinal muscular atrophy Many neuromuscular diseases are genetic, which means they run in families or there is a mutation in your genes. Sometimes, an immune system disorder can cause them. Most of them have no cure. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms, increase mobility and lengthen life."

Interpreting the numbers In the United States, cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. In Canada and many European countries, cholesterol levels are measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To interpret your test results, use these general guidelines. Children and cholesterol testing For most children, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends one cholesterol screening test between the ages of 9 and 11, and another cholesterol screening test between the ages of 17 and 21. Cholesterol testing is usually avoided between the ages of 12 and 16 because false-negative results are more likely within this age group.

Here's what you need to know about the process:\n\n1. **Preparation**: You may be asked to fast for 9-12 hours before the test to ensure accurate results. Fasting means avoiding all food and drinks except water. However, some laboratories or healthcare providers might not require fasting for this test, so it's essential to follow the specific instructions given by your healthcare provider.\n\n2. **The Test**: The test itself involves drawing a sample of blood from a vein in your arm. This is usually done with a needle and syringe or a machine that uses a vacuum tube to collect the blood sample.\n\n3. **What the Test Measures**: The lipid profile measures several components of your blood cholesterol, including:\n   - **Total Cholesterol**: This is the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\n   - **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol**: Often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol, high levels of LDL can lead to the buildup of plaque in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke.\n   - **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol**: Known as \"good\" cholesterol, HDL helps remove other forms of cholesterol from your bloodstream. Higher levels of HDL are associated with a lower risk of heart disease.\n   - **Triglycerides**: These are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides, which are stored in your fat cells. Later, hormones release triglycerides for energy between meals. High triglyceride levels can contribute to hardening or thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\n\n4. **Understanding the Results**: Your healthcare provider will analyze the results of your lipid profile and might consider other factors, such as your age, sex, and overall health, to assess your risk of heart disease and decide on the best course of action. Generally, the following levels are considered healthy for adults:\n   - Total Cholesterol: Less than 200 mg/dL\n   - LDL Cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL (although this can vary depending on your risk of heart disease)\n   - HDL Cholesterol: 60 mg/dL or higher\n   - Triglycerides: Less than 150 mg/dL\n\n5. **What to Do Next**: Depending on your cholesterol levels and other risk factors for heart disease, your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle changes, such as diet adjustments, increased physical activity, weight loss, or quitting smoking, to help lower your cholesterol levels. In some cases, medication might be prescribed to help manage your cholesterol levels.\n\nIt's essential to follow the advice of your healthcare provider regarding cholesterol testing and any subsequent treatment or lifestyle recommendations.

Here's what you need to know about the process:\n\n1. **Preparation**: You may be asked to fast for 9-12 hours before the test to ensure accurate results. Fasting means avoiding all food and drinks except water. However, some laboratories or healthcare providers might not require fasting for this test, so it's essential to follow the specific instructions given by your healthcare provider.\n\n2. **The Test**: The test itself involves drawing a sample of blood from a vein in your arm. This is usually done with a needle and syringe or a machine that uses a vacuum tube to collect the blood sample.\n\n3. **What the Test Measures**: The lipid profile measures several components of your blood cholesterol, including:\n   - **Total Cholesterol**: This is the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\n   - **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol**: Often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol, high levels of LDL can lead to the buildup of plaque in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke.\n   - **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol**: Known as \"good\" cholesterol, HDL helps remove other forms of cholesterol from your bloodstream. Higher levels of HDL are associated with a lower risk of heart disease.\n   - **Triglycerides**: These are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides, which are stored in your fat cells. Later, hormones release triglycerides for energy between meals. High triglyceride levels can contribute to hardening or thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\n\n4. **Understanding the Results**: Your healthcare provider will analyze the results of your lipid profile and might consider other factors, such as your age, sex, and overall health, to assess your risk of heart disease and decide on the best course of action.

In some cases, medication might be prescribed to help manage your cholesterol levels.\n\nIt's essential to follow the advice of your healthcare provider regarding cholesterol testing and any subsequent treatment or lifestyle recommendations. Regular monitoring of your cholesterol levels and adherence to your healthcare provider's guidance can help you maintain good cardiovascular health.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHigh cholesterol (Diagnosis): A blood test to check cholesterol levels - called a lipid panel or lipid profile - typically reports: - Total cholesterol - LDL cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - Triglycerides - a type of fat in the blood For the most accurate measurements, don't eat or drink anything (other than water) for nine to 12 hours before the blood sample is taken. Interpreting the numbers In the United States, cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. In Canada and many European countries, cholesterol levels are measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To interpret your test results, use these general guidelines. Children and cholesterol testing For most children, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends one cholesterol screening test between the ages of 9 and 11, and another cholesterol screening test between the ages of 17 and 21. Cholesterol testing is usually avoided between the ages of 12 and 16 because false-negative results are more likely within this age group. If your child has a family history of early-onset heart disease or a personal history of obesity or diabetes, your doctor may recommend earlier or more frequent cholesterol testing.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program."

The treatment for a heart attack typically involves a combination of medications, procedures, and lifestyle changes. Here are the common treatment options:\n\n**Immediate Treatment:**\n\n1. **medications**: Aspirin is usually given to help prevent further blood clotting. Other medications, such as beta blockers, nitroglycerin, and morphine, may be administered to help reduce the heart's workload, improve blood flow, and relieve pain.\n2. **Oxygen therapy**: Oxygen is given to help increase oxygen levels in the blood and reduce the heart's workload.\n3. **Cardiac catheterization**: This procedure involves inserting a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) into an artery in the leg or arm and guiding it to the blocked artery in the heart. A balloon angioplasty or stenting may be performed to open up the blocked artery.\n\n**Procedures:**\n\n1. **Angioplasty**: A balloon is inflated to open up the blocked artery, and a stent (a small, mesh tube) may be placed to keep the artery open.\n2. **Thrombolytic therapy**: Medications are given to dissolve the blood clot that is blocking the artery.\n3. **Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)**: Surgery is performed to bypass the blocked artery and restore blood flow to the heart.\n\n**Medications:**\n\n1. **Antiplatelet agents**: Medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel, are given to prevent further blood clotting.\n2. **Beta blockers**: Medications, such as metoprolol or carvedilol, are given to reduce the heart's workload and improve blood flow.\n3. **ACE inhibitors**: Medications, such as lisinopril or enalapril, are given to lower blood pressure and reduce the heart's workload.\n4. **Statins**: Medications, such as atorvastatin or simvastatin, are given to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of another heart attack.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes:**\n\n1. **Quit smoking**: Smoking cessation is essential to reduce the risk of another heart attack.\n2. **Healthy diet**: A heart-healthy diet, low in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol, is recommended.\n3. **Regular exercise**: Regular physical activity, such as walking or swimming, can help improve cardiovascular health.\n4. **Weight management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce the risk of another heart attack.\n5. **Stress management**: Stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation or yoga, can help manage stress and reduce the risk of another heart attack.\n\n**Rehabilitation:**\n\n1. **Cardiac rehabilitation program**: A program that includes exercise, education, and counseling to help patients recover from a heart attack and reduce the risk of another heart attack.\n\nIt's essential to note that the treatment for a heart attack should be individualized and guided by a healthcare professional.

              "text": "Asthma (Diagnosis): Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma\u2014that is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on. You may need to see an asthma specialist if: You need special tests to help diagnose asthma You've had a life-threatening asthma attack You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled You're thinking about getting allergy treatments Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to \"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\" Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. Diagnostic Tests Lung Function Test Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include: Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old. A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: One or both parents have asthma The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. Doctors also may use a 4\u20136 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds."

Here's a step-by-step guide on how asthma is typically diagnosed:\n\n1. **Medical History**: A doctor will ask questions about your symptoms, such as:\n\t* When did your symptoms start?\n\t* How often do you experience symptoms?\n\t* What triggers your symptoms (e.g., exercise, allergens, cold air)?\n\t* Have you had any previous respiratory problems or allergies?\n2. **Physical Examination**: A doctor will perform a physical examination to:\n\t* Listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to check for wheezing, coughing, or other abnormal sounds.\n\t* Check your overall health and look for signs of respiratory problems.\n3. **Lung Function Tests**: The following tests may be used to assess lung function:\n\t* **Spirometry**: This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out, and how quickly you can breathe out. It's often used to diagnose asthma and monitor its severity.\n\t* **Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Meter**: This test measures the fastest rate at which you can breathe out air.\n4. **Methacholine Challenge Test**: This test may be used to diagnose asthma if the results of the lung function tests are inconclusive. The test involves inhaling increasing amounts of methacholine, a substance that can trigger airway constriction in people with asthma.\n5. **Other Tests**: Additional tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as:\n\t* **Chest X-ray**: To rule out other lung problems, such as pneumonia or bronchitis.\n\t* **Allergy testing**: To identify potential allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms.\n\t* **Blood tests**: To check for signs of inflammation or infection.\n\n**Diagnosis Criteria**: To diagnose asthma, a doctor will look for a combination of the following:\n\t* Recurring symptoms, such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness.\n\t* Airflow limitation, as measured by lung function tests.\n\t* Reversibility of symptoms, either spontaneously or with treatment.\n\t* Exclusion of other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.\n\n**Classification of Asthma Severity**: Once asthma is diagnosed, it's classified into different severity levels, including:\n\t* **Mild intermittent**: Symptoms occur less than twice a week, and nighttime symptoms occur less than twice a month.\n\t* **Mild persistent**: Symptoms occur more than twice a week, but less than once a day, and nighttime symptoms occur more than twice a month.\n\t* **Moderate persistent**: Symptoms occur daily, and nighttime symptoms occur more than once a week.\n\t* **Severe persistent**: Symptoms occur throughout the day, and nighttime symptoms occur frequently.\n\nIt's essential to work with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment and management for your specific asthma diagnosis.",

The cells are then analyzed for chromosomal abnormalities.\n\n4. **Amniocentesis**: Performed after the 15th week of pregnancy, this test involves withdrawing a sample of the fluid that surrounds the fetus (amniotic fluid) to analyze the fetal cells for genetic abnormalities.\n\n5. **Maternal Serum Screening**: This blood test measures the levels of certain substances in the mother's blood that are associated with an increased risk of chromosomal anomalies.

Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called translocation.

Here's an overview of the diagnostic process:\n\n1. **Medical History and Physical Exam**: The first step in diagnosing GAD is a thorough medical history and physical examination to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing or contributing to the symptoms of anxiety. This is important because some medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders, can mimic or exacerbate anxiety symptoms.\n\n2. **Psychological Evaluation**: A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, will conduct a psychological evaluation. This involves a detailed interview to assess the individual's symptoms, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The professional will look for the presence of excessive and persistent worry or fear that is difficult to control and causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of life.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Criteria**: The diagnosis of GAD is based on the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of GAD requires:\n   - Excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least 6 months about a number of things (such as work, school, or finances).\n   - Difficulty controlling the worry.\n   - The anxiety and worry are associated with at least three of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months):\n     - Restlessness, feeling on edge, or irritability.\n     - Being easily fatigued.\n     - Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.\n     - Irritability.\n     - Muscle tension.\n     - Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).\n   - The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n   - The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.\n\n4. **Assessment Tools**: Mental health professionals may use standardized assessment tools or questionnaires, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), to help assess the severity of symptoms.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**: It's crucial to differentiate GAD from other anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias, as well as from other mental health conditions like depression, which can have overlapping symptoms.\n\n6. **Treatment Planning**: Once a diagnosis of GAD is made, the mental health professional will work with the individual to develop a treatment plan, which may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), medication (like antidepressants or benzodiazepines), or a combination of both, along with lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms.\n\nIt's essential for individuals experiencing symptoms of anxiety to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and to discuss the most appropriate treatment options.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the diagnostic process:\n\n1. **Medical History and Physical Examination**: A healthcare provider will start by asking about your symptoms, sexual history, and any previous sexually transmitted infections (STIs). They will also perform a physical examination to look for signs of infection, such as discharge, pain, or swelling in the genital area.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests**: To confirm the diagnosis, laboratory tests are necessary. The most common tests used to diagnose gonorrhea include:\n   - **Urine Test**: This is a non-invasive test where a urine sample is collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis. It can detect the presence of the bacteria that cause gonorrhea.\n   - **Swab Test**: A swab of the infected area (such as the cervix in women, the urethra in men, or the throat and anus in both sexes if those areas are suspected to be infected) can be taken and sent to a laboratory for culture or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). NAATs are highly sensitive and can detect small amounts of bacterial DNA.\n   - **Discharge or Tissue Sample**: If there's noticeable discharge, a sample can be taken directly from the infected site for examination under a microscope or for culture.\n\n3. **Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)**: NAATs are the most commonly used tests for gonorrhea diagnosis due to their high sensitivity and specificity. They can be performed on urine samples or swabs from the genital and extragenital sites and can provide results quickly.\n\n4. **Gram Stain**: A Gram stain is a method of identifying bacteria under a microscope by applying a series of dyes. While it's more commonly used for diagnosing other infections, it can sometimes be used to quickly identify gonorrhea, especially in men with urethral discharge.\n\n5. **Culture**: Although culture is considered a gold standard for diagnosing many bacterial infections, it's less commonly used for gonorrhea today due to the availability of NAATs, which are faster and more sensitive.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n- **Co-infection with Chlamydia**: Because gonorrhea and chlamydia are often transmitted together, patients diagnosed with gonorrhea are frequently tested for chlamydia as well, and treatment for both infections is commonly provided simultaneously.\n\n- **Antibiotic Resistance**: Given the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations recommend dual antibiotic therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.\n\n- **Follow-Up**: After completing treatment, it's essential to follow up with a healthcare provider to ensure the infection has been fully cleared, as antibiotic resistance and treatment failure are concerns.\n\n**Prevention**:\n\n- **Safe Sex Practices**: Using condoms consistently and correctly can significantly reduce the risk of gonorrhea and other STIs.\n- **Regular Testing**: Individuals who are sexually active, especially those with multiple partners, should undergo regular STI screening, even if symptoms are not present, as many STIs can be asymptomatic.\n\nGonorrhea diagnosis and treatment should be managed under the care of a healthcare provider to ensure proper treatment and to prevent the spread of infection to others.",

              "text": "Hemophilia: Espa\u00f1ol Hemophilia (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah) is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally. If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. Overview Hemophilia usually is inherited. \"Inherited\u201d means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. People born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrow\u2014a sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. The two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9). Rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \"Acquired\u201d means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. This article focuses on inherited hemophilia. Outlook Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. People who don't have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than\u00a0 1 percent. Hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year. Hemophilia A Classic hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency Hemophilia B Christmas disease Factor IX deficiency A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz). Chromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors. A male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \"hemophilia carrier\u201d and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding. Very rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females. Some males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren't carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child. Below are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 1 Each daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 2 Each daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia. The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Excessive Bleeding The extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is. Children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision. Bleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding). Signs of external bleeding may include: Bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth Nosebleeds for no obvious reason Heavy bleeding from a minor cut Bleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time Signs of internal bleeding may include: Blood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder) Blood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach) Large bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body) Bleeding in the Joints Bleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury. At first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend. Swelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint. Bleeding in the Brain Internal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include: Long-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or changes in behavior Sudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease. You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out: How long it takes for your blood to clot Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is. Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia. Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults. The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different. Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies. Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have \"preimplantation diagnosis\" to have children who don't have hemophilia. For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb. Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at home\u2014it only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include: Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working. These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 20\u201330 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 2\u20135 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to: Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: \u00a0 Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages: You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \"Living With Hemophilia\u201d). Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You? The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having. Mild hemophilia\u2014Replacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophilia\u2014You may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophilia\u2014You usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment. If you or your child has hemophilia, you can take steps to prevent bleeding problems. Thanks to improvements in treatment, a child who has hemophilia today is likely to live a normal lifespan. Hemophilia Treatment Centers The Federal Government funds a nationwide network of hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). These centers are an important resource for people who have hemophilia and their families. The medical experts at HTCs provide treatment, education, and support. They can teach you or your family members how to do home treatments. Center staff also can provide your doctor with information. People who get care at HTCs are less likely than those who get care elsewhere to have bleeding complications and hospitalizations. They're also more likely to have a better quality of life. This may be due to the centers' emphasis on bleeding prevention and the education and support provided to patients and their caregivers. More than 100 federally funded HTCs are located throughout the United States. Many HTCs are located at major university medical and research centers. The hemophilia teams at these centers include: Nurse coordinators Pediatricians (doctors who treat children) and adult and pediatric hematologists (doctors who specialize in blood disorders) Social workers (who can help with financial issues, transportation, mental health, and other issues) Physical therapists and orthopedists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the bones and joints) Dentists To find an HTC located near you, go to the directory of HTCs on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site. Many people who have hemophilia go to HTCs for annual checkups, even if it means traveling some distance to do so. At an HTC, you or your child may be able to take part in clinical research and benefit from the latest hemophilia research findings. The HTC team also will work with your local health care providers to help meet your needs or your child's needs. Ongoing Care If you have hemophilia, you can take steps to avoid complications. For example: Follow your treatment plan exactly as your doctor prescribes. Have regular checkups and vaccinations as recommended. Tell all of your health care providers\u2014such as your doctor, dentist, and pharmacist\u2014that you have hemophilia. You also may want to tell people like your employee health nurse, gym trainer, and sports coach about your condition. Have regular dental care. Dentists at the HTCs are experts in providing dental care for people who have hemophilia. If you see another dentist, tell him or her that you have hemophilia. The dentist can provide medicine that will reduce bleeding during dental work. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding in joints and other parts of the body. Know when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. For example, you'll need care if you have: - Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. - Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. - Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. It's a good idea to keep a record of all previous treatments. Be sure to take this information with you to medical appointments and to the hospital or emergency room. If Your Child Is Diagnosed With Hemophilia You may have emotional, financial, social, or other strains as you adjust to having a child who has hemophilia. Learn all you can about the disorder and get the support you need. Talk with doctors and other health care providers about treatment, prevention of bleeding, and what to do during an emergency. The care teams at HTCs can provide your child with treatment and help educate and support you. The social worker on the team can help with emotional issues, financial and transportation problems, and other concerns. Seek the many resources available through the Web, books, and other materials, including those provided by national and local hemophilia organizations. Look into support groups that offer a variety of activities for children who have hemophilia and for family members. Some groups offer summer camps for children who have hemophilia. Ask your doctor, nurse coordinator, or social worker about these groups and camps. Challenges will occur as your child grows and becomes more active. In addition to treatment and regular health and dental care, your child needs information about hemophilia that he or she can understand. Children who have hemophilia also need ongoing support, and they need to be reassured that the condition isn't their fault. Young children who have hemophilia need extra protection from things in the home and elsewhere that could cause injuries and bleeding: Protect toddlers with kneepads, elbow pads, and protective helmets. All children should wear safety helmets when riding tricycles or bicycles. Be sure to use the safety belts and straps in highchairs, car seats, and strollers to protect your child from falls. Remove furniture with sharp corners or pad them while your child is a toddler. Keep out of reach or locked away small and sharp objects and other items that could cause bleeding or harm. Check play equipment and outdoor play areas for possible hazards. You also should learn how to examine your child for and recognize signs of bleeding. Learn to prepare for bleeding episodes when they occur. Keep a cold pack in the freezer ready to use as directed or to take along with you to treat bumps and bruises. Popsicles work fine when there is minor bleeding in the mouth. You also might want to keep a bag ready to go with items you'll need if you must take your child to the emergency room or elsewhere. Be sure that anyone who is responsible for your child knows that he or she has hemophilia. Talk with your child's babysitters, daycare providers, teachers, other school staff, and coaches or leaders of afterschool activities about when to contact you or to call 9\u20131\u20131 for emergency care. Your child should wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace. If your child is injured, the ID will alert anyone caring for your child about his or her hemophilia. Physical Activity and Hemophilia Physical activity helps keep muscles flexible, strengthens joints, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Children and adults who have hemophilia should be physically active, but they may have limits on what they can do safely. People who have mild hemophilia can take part in many activities. Those who have severe hemophilia should avoid contact sports and other activities that are likely to lead to injuries that could cause bleeding. Examples of these activities include football, hockey, and wrestling. Physical therapists at HTCs can develop exercise programs tailored to your needs and teach you how to exercise safely. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about recommended types of physical activity and sports. In general, some safe physical activities are swimming, biking (wearing a helmet), walking, and golf. To prevent bleeding, you also may be able to take clotting factors prior to exercise or a sporting event. Medicine Precautions Some medicines increase the risk of bleeding, such as: Aspirin and other medicines that contain salicylates (sa-LIH-sil-ates) Ibuprofen, naproxen, and some other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Treatment at Home and When Traveling Home treatment with replacement therapy has many benefits. It lets you treat bleeding early, before complications are likely to develop. Home treatment also can prevent frequent trips to the doctor's office or hospital. This can give you more independence and control over your hemophilia. However, if you're treating yourself or your child with clotting factors at home, you should take some steps for safety: Follow instructions for storage, preparation, and use of clotting factors and treatment materials. Keep a record of all medical treatment. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding, infection, or an allergic reaction, and know the correct way to respond. Have someone with you when you treat yourself. Know when to call the doctor or 9\u20131\u20131. When you're traveling, be sure to take enough treatment supplies along. You also should carry a letter from your doctor describing your hemophilia and treatment. It's a good idea to find out in advance where to go for care when out of town. Cost Issues Clotting factors are very costly. Many health insurance companies will only pay for clotting factors on a case-by-case basis. It's important to know: What your insurance covers Whether your insurance has a limit on the dollar amount it will cover and what that amount is Whether restrictions or waiting periods apply As children grow, it's important to learn about available options for insurance. Look into what kinds of health insurance are offered when seeking a job."

Treatment for hemophilia typically involves replacing the deficient clotting factor in the blood, which can be achieved through several methods:\n\n1. **Clotting Factor Replacement Therapy**: This is the primary treatment for hemophilia. It involves infusing the specific clotting factor that is lacking or deficient into the bloodstream. This can be done on demand (to treat a bleed when it happens) or as prophylaxis (to prevent bleeds before they occur).

If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. Overview Hemophilia usually is inherited. \"Inherited\u201d means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. People born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrow\u2014a sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. The two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9). Rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \"Acquired\u201d means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. This article focuses on inherited hemophilia. Outlook Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. People who don't have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than\u00a0 1 percent. Hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year. Hemophilia A Classic hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency Hemophilia B Christmas disease Factor IX deficiency A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz). Chromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors. A male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \"hemophilia carrier\u201d and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding. Very rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females. Some males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren't carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child. Below are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 1 Each daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 2 Each daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia. The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Excessive Bleeding The extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is. Children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision. Bleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding). Signs of external bleeding may include: Bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth Nosebleeds for no obvious reason Heavy bleeding from a minor cut Bleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time Signs of internal bleeding may include: Blood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder) Blood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach) Large bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body) Bleeding in the Joints Bleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury. At first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend. Swelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint. Bleeding in the Brain Internal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include: Long-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or changes in behavior Sudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease. You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out: How long it takes for your blood to clot Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is. Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia. Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults. The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different. Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies. Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have \"preimplantation diagnosis\" to have children who don't have hemophilia. For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb. Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at home\u2014it only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include: Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working. These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 20\u201330 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 2\u20135 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to: Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: \u00a0 Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages: You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \"Living With Hemophilia\u201d). Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You? The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having. Mild hemophilia\u2014Replacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophilia\u2014You may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophilia\u2014You usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment. If you or your child has hemophilia, you can take steps to prevent bleeding problems. Thanks to improvements in treatment, a child who has hemophilia today is likely to live a normal lifespan. Hemophilia Treatment Centers The Federal Government funds a nationwide network of hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). These centers are an important resource for people who have hemophilia and their families. The medical experts at HTCs provide treatment, education, and support. They can teach you or your family members how to do home treatments. Center staff also can provide your doctor with information. People who get care at HTCs are less likely than those who get care elsewhere to have bleeding complications and hospitalizations. They're also more likely to have a better quality of life. This may be due to the centers' emphasis on bleeding prevention and the education and support provided to patients and their caregivers. More than 100 federally funded HTCs are located throughout the United States. Many HTCs are located at major university medical and research centers. The hemophilia teams at these centers include: Nurse coordinators Pediatricians (doctors who treat children) and adult and pediatric hematologists (doctors who specialize in blood disorders) Social workers (who can help with financial issues, transportation, mental health, and other issues) Physical therapists and orthopedists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the bones and joints) Dentists To find an HTC located near you, go to the directory of HTCs on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site. Many people who have hemophilia go to HTCs for annual checkups, even if it means traveling some distance to do so. At an HTC, you or your child may be able to take part in clinical research and benefit from the latest hemophilia research findings. The HTC team also will work with your local health care providers to help meet your needs or your child's needs. Ongoing Care If you have hemophilia, you can take steps to avoid complications. For example: Follow your treatment plan exactly as your doctor prescribes. Have regular checkups and vaccinations as recommended. Tell all of your health care providers\u2014such as your doctor, dentist, and pharmacist\u2014that you have hemophilia. You also may want to tell people like your employee health nurse, gym trainer, and sports coach about your condition. Have regular dental care. Dentists at the HTCs are experts in providing dental care for people who have hemophilia. If you see another dentist, tell him or her that you have hemophilia. The dentist can provide medicine that will reduce bleeding during dental work. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding in joints and other parts of the body. Know when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. For example, you'll need care if you have: - Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. - Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. - Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. It's a good idea to keep a record of all previous treatments. Be sure to take this information with you to medical appointments and to the hospital or emergency room. If Your Child Is Diagnosed With Hemophilia You may have emotional, financial, social, or other strains as you adjust to having a child who has hemophilia. Learn all you can about the disorder and get the support you need. Talk with doctors and other health care providers about treatment, prevention of bleeding, and what to do during an emergency. The care teams at HTCs can provide your child with treatment and help educate and support you. The social worker on the team can help with emotional issues, financial and transportation problems, and other concerns. Seek the many resources available through the Web, books, and other materials, including those provided by national and local hemophilia organizations. Look into support groups that offer a variety of activities for children who have hemophilia and for family members. Some groups offer summer camps for children who have hemophilia. Ask your doctor, nurse coordinator, or social worker about these groups and camps. Challenges will occur as your child grows and becomes more active. In addition to treatment and regular health and dental care, your child needs information about hemophilia that he or she can understand. Children who have hemophilia also need ongoing support, and they need to be reassured that the condition isn't their fault. Young children who have hemophilia need extra protection from things in the home and elsewhere that could cause injuries and bleeding: Protect toddlers with kneepads, elbow pads, and protective helmets. All children should wear safety helmets when riding tricycles or bicycles. Be sure to use the safety belts and straps in highchairs, car seats, and strollers to protect your child from falls. Remove furniture with sharp corners or pad them while your child is a toddler. Keep out of reach or locked away small and sharp objects and other items that could cause bleeding or harm. Check play equipment and outdoor play areas for possible hazards. You also should learn how to examine your child for and recognize signs of bleeding. Learn to prepare for bleeding episodes when they occur. Keep a cold pack in the freezer ready to use as directed or to take along with you to treat bumps and bruises. Popsicles work fine when there is minor bleeding in the mouth. You also might want to keep a bag ready to go with items you'll need if you must take your child to the emergency room or elsewhere. Be sure that anyone who is responsible for your child knows that he or she has hemophilia. Talk with your child's babysitters, daycare providers, teachers, other school staff, and coaches or leaders of afterschool activities about when to contact you or to call 9\u20131\u20131 for emergency care. Your child should wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace. If your child is injured, the ID will alert anyone caring for your child about his or her hemophilia. Physical Activity and Hemophilia Physical activity helps keep muscles flexible, strengthens joints, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Children and adults who have hemophilia should be physically active, but they may have limits on what they can do safely. People who have mild hemophilia can take part in many activities. Those who have severe hemophilia should avoid contact sports and other activities that are likely to lead to injuries that could cause bleeding. Examples of these activities include football, hockey, and wrestling. Physical therapists at HTCs can develop exercise programs tailored to your needs and teach you how to exercise safely. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about recommended types of physical activity and sports. In general, some safe physical activities are swimming, biking (wearing a helmet), walking, and golf. To prevent bleeding, you also may be able to take clotting factors prior to exercise or a sporting event. Medicine Precautions Some medicines increase the risk of bleeding, such as: Aspirin and other medicines that contain salicylates (sa-LIH-sil-ates) Ibuprofen, naproxen, and some other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Treatment at Home and When Traveling Home treatment with replacement therapy has many benefits. It lets you treat bleeding early, before complications are likely to develop. Home treatment also can prevent frequent trips to the doctor's office or hospital. This can give you more independence and control over your hemophilia. However, if you're treating yourself or your child with clotting factors at home, you should take some steps for safety: Follow instructions for storage, preparation, and use of clotting factors and treatment materials. Keep a record of all medical treatment. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding, infection, or an allergic reaction, and know the correct way to respond. Have someone with you when you treat yourself. Know when to call the doctor or 9\u20131\u20131. When you're traveling, be sure to take enough treatment supplies along. You also should carry a letter from your doctor describing your hemophilia and treatment. It's a good idea to find out in advance where to go for care when out of town. Cost Issues Clotting factors are very costly. Many health insurance companies will only pay for clotting factors on a case-by-case basis. It's important to know: What your insurance covers Whether your insurance has a limit on the dollar amount it will cover and what that amount is Whether restrictions or waiting periods apply As children grow, it's important to learn about available options for insurance. Look into what kinds of health insurance are offered when seeking a job.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The passing down of CHD from parents to offspring involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n**Genetic Factors:**\n\n1. **Family History:** Having a family history of CHD increases the risk of passing it down to the next generation. If one or more family members have CHD, the risk of having a child with CHD is higher.\n2. **Genetic Mutations:** Certain genetic mutations, such as those that affect the development of the heart, can be inherited from parents. These mutations can increase the risk of CHD.\n3. **Chromosomal Abnormalities:** Chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, can increase the risk of CHD.\n\n**How CHD is Passed Down:**\n\n1. **Autosomal Dominant Inheritance:** Some cases of CHD are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to increase the risk of CHD. If one parent has the mutated gene, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and developing CHD.\n2. **Autosomal Recessive Inheritance:** Other cases of CHD are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a child needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop CHD.\n3. **X-Linked Inheritance:** Some cases of CHD are inherited in an X-linked pattern, meaning that the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome. If a mother carries the mutated gene, each son has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and developing CHD, while each daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier.\n\n**Environmental Factors:**\n\n1. **Maternal Health:** Certain maternal health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure, can increase the risk of CHD in the offspring.\n2. **Exposure to Teratogens:** Exposure to certain teratogens, such as rubella (German measles), during pregnancy can increase the risk of CHD.\n\n**Reducing the Risk:**\n\nWhile some cases of CHD cannot be prevented, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk:\n\n1. **Genetic Counseling:** If there is a family history of CHD, genetic counseling can help determine the risk of passing it down to the next generation.\n2. **Prenatal Care:** Regular prenatal care can help identify any potential issues with the developing fetus, including CHD.\n3. **Healthy Lifestyle:** Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding teratogens, can help reduce the risk of CHD.\n\nIt's essential to note that not all cases of CHD are preventable, and many cases occur without a known genetic or environmental cause. If you have concerns about CHD or a family history of the condition, consult with a healthcare professional or a genetic counselor for personalized guidance.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\ncritical congenital heart disease (Inheritance Pattern): Most cases of CCHD are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

              "text": "Spinal and epidural anesthesia: Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine. The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist. First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic. You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly. For an epidural: - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space. - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth. - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure. For a spinal: - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed. - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures. Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). People usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk. Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures. Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when: - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine. - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet. - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure. - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications: - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma) - Difficulty urinating - Drop in blood pressure - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess) - Nerve damage - Seizures (this is rare) - Severe headache Tell your health care provider: - If you are or could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the procedure: - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before. - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinners. - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure. - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic. - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. On the day of the procedure: - Follow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking. - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure. - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. - Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours. This is to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

While they can provide significant relief for some people suffering from low back pain, it's essential to understand the possible negative effects. Here are some of the ways epidural steroid injections can be harmful:\n\n1. **Infection**: As with any invasive procedure, there's a risk of infection when the epidural space is accessed. This can range from mild to severe infections that could potentially spread to other parts of the body.\n\n2. **Bleeding or Hematoma**: Bleeding is a risk due to the injection itself, which can lead to the formation of a hematoma (a collection of blood outside of blood vessels). This can put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, leading to neurological problems.\n\n3. **Nerve Damage**: The injection can inadvertently damage the nerves, leading to persistent pain, numbness, tingling, or even paralysis in extreme cases. The risk, although small, is a significant consideration.\n\n4. **Dural Puncture**: Accidental puncture of the dura (a membrane that envelops the spinal cord) can lead to a headache known as a post-dural puncture headache (PDPH), which can be severe and persistent.\n\n5. **Elevated Blood Sugar**: Corticosteroids can cause an increase in blood sugar levels, which is particularly concerning for people with diabetes. This effect is usually temporary but needs monitoring, especially in diabetic patients.\n\n6. **Weight Gain**: Steroids can cause weight gain due to increased appetite and water retention. This might be a concern for people with certain health conditions or those who are trying to manage their weight.\n\n7. **Mood Changes**: Some individuals may experience mood changes, such as irritability, anxiety, or insomnia, following the injection. These are usually transient side effects.\n\n8. **Osteoporosis**: Long-term or frequent use of corticosteroids can lead to osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weakened bones, making them more susceptible to fractures.\n\n9. **Cataracts and Glaucoma**: There is an association between long-term steroid use and the development of cataracts and glaucoma, highlighting the importance of monitoring eye health in patients receiving these injections.\n\n10. **Adrenal Insufficiency**: The body's natural production of corticosteroids can be suppressed by exogenous steroid administration, potentially leading to adrenal insufficiency if the body becomes too reliant on the injected steroids.\n\nIt's crucial for patients to discuss these risks with their healthcare provider to ensure that the benefits of the epidural steroid injection outweigh the potential harms for their specific condition. Additionally, the decision to proceed with such a procedure should be made after considering alternative treatments and under the guidance of a qualified medical professional.",

They are given through shots in or around the spine. The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist. First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic. You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly. For an epidural: - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space. - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth. - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure. For a spinal: - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed. - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures. Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). People usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk. Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures. Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when: - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine. - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet. - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure. - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications: - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma) - Difficulty urinating - Drop in blood pressure - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess) - Nerve damage - Seizures (this is rare) - Severe headache Tell your health care provider: - If you are or could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the procedure: - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before. - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinners. - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure. - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic. - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. On the day of the procedure: - Follow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking. - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure. - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. - Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy.

To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, you may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for days or weeks as you go about your everyday life. - Stay in a special hospital where brain activity can be recorded while video cameras capture what happens to you during the seizure. This is called video EEG. Tests that may be done include: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan is often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain."

Here's a step-by-step guide on how epilepsy is diagnosed:\n\n1. **Medical History**: A doctor will start by taking a detailed medical history, including the patient's symptoms, seizure events, and any previous medical conditions. This information helps the doctor identify potential patterns and triggers for the seizures.\n2. **Physical Examination**: A physical examination is conducted to look for any signs of neurological disorders or other conditions that may be contributing to the seizures.\n3. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: An EEG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain. It's commonly used to diagnose epilepsy and can help identify the type of seizures a person is experiencing. During an EEG, electrodes are placed on the scalp to record brain activity.\n4. **Imaging Tests**: Imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans may be ordered to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities in the brain that could be causing the seizures.\n5. **Blood Tests**: Blood tests may be conducted to check for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the seizures, such as infections, electrolyte imbalances, or metabolic disorders.\n6. **Neuropsychological Tests**: Neuropsychological tests may be used to assess cognitive function and identify any potential areas of strength or weakness.\n7. **Seizure Observation**: In some cases, a doctor may observe a patient's seizure activity to better understand the type and severity of the seizures.\n8. **Video Electroencephalogram (Video EEG)**: A video EEG is a test that records a patient's brain activity and behavior during a seizure. This test can help doctors diagnose the type of epilepsy and identify the seizure focus.\n\n**Diagnostic Criteria**: To diagnose epilepsy, a doctor will look for the following criteria:\n\n* At least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart\n* A single unprovoked seizure with evidence of brain abnormality or a high risk of recurrence\n* A diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome, such as temporal lobe epilepsy or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\n\n**Types of Epilepsy**: There are several types of epilepsy, including:\n\n* Idiopathic epilepsy (no known cause)\n* Symptomatic epilepsy (caused by a known medical condition or injury)\n* Cryptogenic epilepsy (cause unknown, but suspected to be related to a brain abnormality)\n\nA accurate diagnosis of epilepsy requires a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional, taking into account the patient's medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic test results.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nEpilepsy - overview (Exams and Tests): The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with epilepsy often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, you may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for days or weeks as you go about your everyday life. - Stay in a special hospital where brain activity can be recorded while video cameras capture what happens to you during the seizure. This is called video EEG. Tests that may be done include: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan is often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "How should Ibuprofen be used and what is the dosage?: Prescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen. If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children. Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child. Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops. The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water. Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child's pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days. Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition."

              "text": "Nicotine dependence: Nicotine dependence -- also called tobacco dependence -- is an addiction to tobacco products caused by the drug nicotine. Nicotine dependence means you can't stop using the substance, even though it's causing you harm. Nicotine produces physical and mood-altering effects in your brain that are temporarily pleasing. These effects make you want to use tobacco and lead to dependence. At the same time, stopping tobacco use causes withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and anxiety. While it's the nicotine in tobacco that causes nicotine dependence, the toxic effects of tobacco result from other substances in tobacco. Smokers have much higher rates of heart disease, stroke and cancer than nonsmokers do. Regardless of how long you've smoked, stopping smoking can improve your health. Many effective treatments for nicotine dependence are available to help you manage withdrawal and stop smoking for good. Ask your doctor for help. For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: - You can't stop smoking. You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. - You experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. - You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. - You give up social or recreational activities in order to smoke. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with certain family members or friends because you can't smoke in these locations or situations. You're not alone if you've tried to stop smoking but haven't been able to stop for good. Most smokers make many attempts to stop smoking before they achieve stable, long-term abstinence from smoking. You're more likely to stop for good if you follow a treatment plan that addresses both the physical and the behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. Using medications and working with a counselor specially trained to help people stop smoking (a tobacco treatment specialist) will significantly boost your chances of success. Ask your doctor, counselor or therapist to help you develop a treatment plan that works for you or to advise you on where to get help to stop smoking. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine is very addictive when delivered by inhaling tobacco smoke into the lungs, which quickly releases nicotine into the blood allowing it to get into the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help regulate mood and behavior. Dopamine, one of these neurotransmitters, is released in the \"reward center\" of the brain and causes improved mood and feelings of pleasure. Experiencing these effects from nicotine is what makes tobacco so addictive. Nicotine dependence involves behavioral (routines, habits, feelings) as well as physical factors. These behavioral associations with smoking may act as triggers - situations or feelings that activate a craving for tobacco, even if you have not smoked for some time. Behaviors and cues that you may associate with smoking include: - Certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, with morning coffee or during breaks at work - After a meal - Drinking alcohol - Certain places or friends - Talking on the phone - Stressful situations or when you're feeling down - Sight or smell of a burning cigarette - Driving your car To overcome your dependence on tobacco, you need to become aware of your triggers and develop a plan to deal with the behaviors and routines that you associate with smoking. Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who will use tobacco include: - Genetics. The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited - genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain's nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes. - Home and peer influence. Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke also are more likely to try cigarettes. Evidence suggests that smoking shown in movies and on the Internet can encourage young people to smoke. - Age. Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you'll become a heavy smoker as an adult. - Depression or other mental illness. Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers. - Substance use. People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 known cancer-causing chemicals and thousands of other harmful substances. Even \"all natural\" or herbal cigarettes have chemicals that are harmful to your health. Smoking harms almost every organ of your body and impairs your body's immune system. About half of all regular smokers will die of a disease caused by tobacco. Women smokers are now at equal risk to men smokers of dying from lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease caused by using tobacco. The negative health effects include: - Lung cancer and other lung diseases. Smoking causes nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancer cases. In addition, smoking causes other lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse. - Other cancers. Smoking is a major cause of cancers of the esophagus, larynx, throat (pharynx) and mouth and is related to cancers of the bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix, and some leukemias. Overall, smoking causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths. - Heart and circulatory system problems. Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attack and stroke. Even smoking just one to four cigarettes daily increases your risk of heart disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition. However, stopping smoking reduces your risk of having a heart attack by 50 percent in the first year. - Diabetes. Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for the development of type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems. - Eye problems. Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration. - Infertility and impotence. Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men. - Pregnancy and newborn complications. Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, lower birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in their newborns. - Cold, flu and other illnesses. Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. - Weakened senses. Smoking deadens your senses of taste and smell, so food isn't as appetizing. - Teeth and gum disease. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammation of the gum (gingivitis) and a serious gum infection that can destroy the support system for teeth (periodontitis). - Physical appearance. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can change the structure of your skin, causing premature aging and wrinkles. Smoking also yellows your teeth, fingers and fingernails. - Risks to your family. Nonsmoking spouses and partners of smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don't live with a smoker. If you smoke, your children will be more prone to SIDS, worsening asthma, ear infections and colds. Your doctor may ask you questions or have you complete a questionnaire to get a sense of how dependent you are on nicotine. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after awakening, the more dependent you are. Knowing your degree of dependence will help your doctor determine the best treatment plan for you. Like most smokers, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt - especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to stop if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination. Medications Many treatments, including nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, have been approved as safe and effective in treating nicotine dependence. Using more than one medication may help you get better results. For example, combining a longer acting medication with a short-acting nicotine replacement product may be beneficial. Talk to your health care provider about the right treatment for you. If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, you smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, or you're under age 18, talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter nicotine replacement products. Nicotine replacement therapy Nicotine replacement therapy gives you nicotine without tobacco and the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Nicotine replacement products help relieve withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The best time to start using nicotine replacement medication is on the date you've set to stop smoking. Some smokers start earlier in order to reduce smoking on their way to stopping altogether. The following nicotine replacement products are available over-the-counter: - Nicotine patch (NicoDerm CQ, Habitrol, others). The patch delivers nicotine through your skin and into your bloodstream. You wear a new patch each day. You typically use the patch for eight weeks or longer. If you haven't been able to stop smoking completely after two weeks of wearing the patch, ask your doctor about adjusting the dose or adding another nicotine replacement product. Common side effects include skin irritation, insomnia and vivid dreams. - Nicotine gum (Nicorette, others). This gum delivers nicotine to your blood through the lining of your mouth. Nicotine gum is often recommended to curb cravings. Chew the gum for a few times until you feel a mild tingling or peppery taste, then park the gum between your cheek and gumline for several minutes. This chewing and parking allows nicotine to be gradually absorbed in your bloodstream. Mouth irritation is a common side effect. Other side effects are often a result of overly vigorous chewing that releases nicotine too quickly. These include heartburn, nausea and hiccups. - Nicotine lozenge (Commit, Nicorette mini lozenge, others). This lozenge dissolves in your mouth and, like nicotine gum, delivers nicotine through the lining of your mouth. Place the lozenge in your mouth between your gumline and cheek or under your tongue and allow it to dissolve. You'll start with one lozenge every one to two hours and gradually increase the time between lozenges. Avoid drinking anything right before, while using or right after the lozenge. Side effects include mouth irritation as well as nicotine-related effects such as heartburn, nausea and hiccups. These nicotine replacement products are available by prescription: - Nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS). The nicotine in this product, sprayed directly into each nostril, is absorbed through your nasal membranes into your blood vessels. The nasal spray delivers nicotine a bit quicker than gum, lozenges or the patch, but not as rapidly as smoking a cigarette. It's usually prescribed for three-month periods for up to six months. Nasal and throat irritation, runny nose, sneezing and coughing are common side effects. - Nicotine inhaler (Nicotrol). This device is shaped something like a cigarette holder. You puff on it, and it delivers nicotine vapor into your mouth. You absorb the nicotine through the lining in your mouth, where it then enters your bloodstream. Common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and occasional coughing. Non-nicotine medications Medications that don't contain nicotine and are available by prescription include: - Bupropion (Zyban). The antidepressant drug bupropion increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, brain chemicals that are also boosted by nicotine. Typically your doctor will advise you to start bupropion one week before you stop smoking. Bupropion has the advantage of helping to minimize weight gain after you quit smoking. Common side effects include insomnia, agitation, headache and dry mouth. If you have a history of seizures or serious head trauma, such as a skull fracture, you shouldn't take this drug. - Varenicline (Chantix). This medication acts on the brain's nicotine receptors, decreasing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the feelings of pleasure you get from smoking. Typically your doctor will advise you to start varenicline one week before you stop smoking. Common side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia and vivid dreams. Rarely, varenicline has been associated with serious psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. - Nortriptyline (Pamelor). This medication may be prescribed if other medications haven't helped. This tricyclic antidepressant acts by increasing the levels of the brain neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Common side effects may include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation. Counseling, support groups and other programs Combining medications with behavioral counseling provides the best chance for establishing long-term smoking abstinence. Medications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms including tobacco craving, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to avoid tobacco over the long run. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be. Several types of counseling and support can help with stopping smoking: - Telephone counseling. No matter where you live, you can take advantage of phone counseling to help you give up tobacco. Every state in the U.S. has a telephone quit line, and some have more than one. To find the options in your state, call 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669). - Individual or group counseling program. Your doctor may recommend local support groups or a treatment program where counseling is provided by a tobacco treatment specialist. Counseling helps you learn techniques for preparing to stop smoking and provides support for you during the process. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs or have tobacco treatment specialists who are certified to provide treatment for nicotine dependence. Nicotine Anonymous groups are available in many locations to provide support for smokers trying to quit. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs - the most intensive treatment available. - Internet-based programs. Several websites offer support and strategies for people who want to stop smoking. BecomeAnEX is free and provides information and techniques as well as blogs, community forums, ask the expert and many other features. Text messaging services, including personalized reminders about a quit-smoking plan, also may prove helpful. Methods to avoid It's not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for cigarette smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe. Even products that deliver nicotine without tobacco are risky. Stick with proven stop-smoking aids and steer clear of the following products: - Dissolvable tobacco products. Tobacco pouches, lozenges, strips or other products contain small amounts of tobacco and nicotine you hold or dissolve in your mouth. There is no evidence they will help you stop smoking and little is known about their health effects. - E-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices that heat liquid containing nicotine into a vapor to be inhaled. Because these products are new, there isn't much data about possible safety risks. Studies of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation have shown mixed results. For these reasons, e-cigarettes aren't recommended for people trying to quit smoking. - Flavored cigarettes. Clove cigarettes (kreteks) and flavored cigarettes (bidis) carry the same health risks as smoking regular cigarettes and can cause additional health problems. Although they're banned in the United States, flavored cigarettes are available in other countries. - Hookahs (narghiles). These are water pipes that burn tobacco, and the smoke is inhaled through a hose. They are not safer than cigarettes. The water does not filter out toxins in the smoke, and the water and pipe have a risk of transmitting infections. - Nicotine lollipops and balms. Products containing nicotine salicylate are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and they pose a risk for accidental use by children. - Pipes and cigars. These products have similar, though less frequent, health risks as cigarettes, and they are not a safe alternative. - Smokeless tobacco and snuff (snus). These products contain nicotine in amounts similar to cigarettes and increase your risk of mouth and throat cancer, tooth and gum diseases, and other health problems. It's important to have a plan for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms are usually the most intense during the first week after you stop smoking. They may continue for several weeks, with declining intensity. Although most nicotine withdrawal symptoms pass within a month, you may occasionally experience a strong urge or craving to smoke months after stopping. Triggers or cues that were associated with your smoking can provoke these urges or cravings. Here's what you can do to help manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Regular physical activity has been found to reduce withdrawal symptoms and help people stop smoking. Exercise also helps avoid potential weight gain often associated with stopping. - Wait out cravings. Cravings or urges usually last less than five minutes. Wash the dishes, go for a walk or have a healthy snack, such as carrots, an apple or sunflower seeds, which will keep your mouth busy. Do something that keeps your hands busy, and before you know it, the urge will have passed. This is why you want to get rid of tobacco supplies when you decide to quit. You don't want to have any on hand when a craving hits. - Identify rationalizations. If you find yourself thinking, \"I'll just smoke one to get through this tough time\" or \"Just one won't hurt,\" recognize it as a message that can derail your plan. Review your reasons for quitting, and replace that thought with something positive to support your stopping. - Talk to a support person. If you're feeling anxious or depressed or need encouragement, a support person can help you get through a difficult craving. - Avoid high-risk situations. Know your triggers, and stay away from people, places and situations that tempt you to smoke. - Eat regular, healthy meals. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink more water. Many products claim to be smoking-cessation aids. Many also claim to be \"natural.\" Just remember that \"natural\" doesn't necessarily mean \"safe.\" Talk with your doctor before trying any alternative medicine treatments. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture involves stimulating points on the body, typically with thin, solid, metallic needles. Several studies have been conducted on the effects of acupuncture or acupressure for smoking cessation, but there's no definitive evidence that it works. - Herbs and supplements. A few studies have been conducted on the dietary supplements SAMe, silver acetate and St. John's wort for the treatment of tobacco dependence, but there is no current evidence that any natural product improves smoking cessation rates. - Hypnosis. Although no evidence supports the use of hypnosis - also called hypnotherapy - in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful. If you choose to pursue hypnosis, talk to your doctor about finding a reputable therapist. - Meditation. Although no evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful to reduce symptoms of anxiety."

Understanding how nicotine affects the brain can provide insights into its addictive nature and its broader implications for health.\n\n### Immediate Effects of Nicotine on the Brain\n\n1. **Stimulation of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChRs):** Nicotine mimics acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in various cognitive functions and muscle contraction. By binding to nAChRs, nicotine increases the release of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.\n\n2. **Dopamine Release:** The increase in dopamine levels is particularly significant because dopamine is associated with pleasure, reward, and motivation. This dopamine release reinforces the behavior of nicotine consumption, contributing to the development of addiction.\n\n3. **Alertness and Arousal:** Nicotine's stimulation of nAChRs also enhances alertness, attention, and memory, partly due to the increased release of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and norepinephrine. This is why many smokers report that smoking helps them concentrate or feel more alert.\n\n### Long-term Effects of Nicotine on the Brain\n\n1. **Neuroadaptation and Tolerance:** With repeated exposure, the brain adapts to the constant presence of nicotine by changing the number and function of nAChRs. This can lead to tolerance, where more nicotine is required to achieve the same effects, further reinforcing addictive behaviors.\n\n2. **Dependence and Addiction:** The adaptations in the brain, especially in dopamine pathways, contribute to nicotine dependence. The withdrawal symptoms that occur when nicotine use is stopped, such as irritability, anxiety, and cravings, are manifestations of this dependence.\n\n3. **Impact on Brain Development:** Nicotine exposure, particularly during adolescence and young adulthood when the brain is still developing, can have lasting effects on brain structure and function. It can disrupt normal brain development, leading to potential long-term cognitive and emotional impairments.\n\n4. **Cognitive Effects:** Chronic nicotine exposure can also affect cognitive functions. While nicotine may enhance certain aspects of cognition in the short term, its long-term use, especially during critical periods of brain development, can impair cognitive performance and increase the risk of dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n### Quitting Nicotine and Brain Recovery\n\nQuitting nicotine can lead to withdrawal symptoms as the brain readjusts to functioning without it. However, over time, the brain can recover, and the number and function of nAChRs can return to pre-nicotine exposure levels. The process of recovery can vary greatly among individuals and is influenced by factors such as the duration and amount of nicotine use, the method of quitting, and individual differences in brain chemistry and resilience.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNicotine's effects on the brain are complex and multifaceted, influencing both immediate cognitive and emotional states and long-term brain health. Understanding these effects is crucial for developing effective strategies for nicotine cessation and for preventing nicotine addiction, especially among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and young adults.",

Nicotine dependence means you can't stop using the substance, even though it's causing you harm. Nicotine produces physical and mood-altering effects in your brain that are temporarily pleasing. These effects make you want to use tobacco and lead to dependence. At the same time, stopping tobacco use causes withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and anxiety. While it's the nicotine in tobacco that causes nicotine dependence, the toxic effects of tobacco result from other substances in tobacco. Smokers have much higher rates of heart disease, stroke and cancer than nonsmokers do. Regardless of how long you've smoked, stopping smoking can improve your health. Many effective treatments for nicotine dependence are available to help you manage withdrawal and stop smoking for good. Ask your doctor for help. For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: - You can't stop smoking. You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. - You experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. - You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. - You give up social or recreational activities in order to smoke. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with certain family members or friends because you can't smoke in these locations or situations. You're not alone if you've tried to stop smoking but haven't been able to stop for good. Most smokers make many attempts to stop smoking before they achieve stable, long-term abstinence from smoking. You're more likely to stop for good if you follow a treatment plan that addresses both the physical and the behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. Using medications and working with a counselor specially trained to help people stop smoking (a tobacco treatment specialist) will significantly boost your chances of success. Ask your doctor, counselor or therapist to help you develop a treatment plan that works for you or to advise you on where to get help to stop smoking. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine is very addictive when delivered by inhaling tobacco smoke into the lungs, which quickly releases nicotine into the blood allowing it to get into the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help regulate mood and behavior. Dopamine, one of these neurotransmitters, is released in the \"reward center\" of the brain and causes improved mood and feelings of pleasure. Experiencing these effects from nicotine is what makes tobacco so addictive. Nicotine dependence involves behavioral (routines, habits, feelings) as well as physical factors. These behavioral associations with smoking may act as triggers - situations or feelings that activate a craving for tobacco, even if you have not smoked for some time. Behaviors and cues that you may associate with smoking include: - Certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, with morning coffee or during breaks at work - After a meal - Drinking alcohol - Certain places or friends - Talking on the phone - Stressful situations or when you're feeling down - Sight or smell of a burning cigarette - Driving your car To overcome your dependence on tobacco, you need to become aware of your triggers and develop a plan to deal with the behaviors and routines that you associate with smoking. Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who will use tobacco include: - Genetics. The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited - genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain's nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes. - Home and peer influence. Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke also are more likely to try cigarettes. Evidence suggests that smoking shown in movies and on the Internet can encourage young people to smoke. - Age. Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you'll become a heavy smoker as an adult. - Depression or other mental illness. Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers. - Substance use. People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 known cancer-causing chemicals and thousands of other harmful substances. Even \"all natural\" or herbal cigarettes have chemicals that are harmful to your health. Smoking harms almost every organ of your body and impairs your body's immune system. About half of all regular smokers will die of a disease caused by tobacco. Women smokers are now at equal risk to men smokers of dying from lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease caused by using tobacco. The negative health effects include: - Lung cancer and other lung diseases. Smoking causes nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancer cases. In addition, smoking causes other lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse. - Other cancers. Smoking is a major cause of cancers of the esophagus, larynx, throat (pharynx) and mouth and is related to cancers of the bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix, and some leukemias. Overall, smoking causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths. - Heart and circulatory system problems. Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attack and stroke. Even smoking just one to four cigarettes daily increases your risk of heart disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition. However, stopping smoking reduces your risk of having a heart attack by 50 percent in the first year. - Diabetes. Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for the development of type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems. - Eye problems. Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration. - Infertility and impotence. Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men. - Pregnancy and newborn complications. Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, lower birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in their newborns. - Cold, flu and other illnesses. Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. - Weakened senses. Smoking deadens your senses of taste and smell, so food isn't as appetizing. - Teeth and gum disease. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammation of the gum (gingivitis) and a serious gum infection that can destroy the support system for teeth (periodontitis). - Physical appearance. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can change the structure of your skin, causing premature aging and wrinkles. Smoking also yellows your teeth, fingers and fingernails. - Risks to your family. Nonsmoking spouses and partners of smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don't live with a smoker. If you smoke, your children will be more prone to SIDS, worsening asthma, ear infections and colds. Your doctor may ask you questions or have you complete a questionnaire to get a sense of how dependent you are on nicotine. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after awakening, the more dependent you are. Knowing your degree of dependence will help your doctor determine the best treatment plan for you. Like most smokers, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt - especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to stop if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination. Medications Many treatments, including nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, have been approved as safe and effective in treating nicotine dependence. Using more than one medication may help you get better results. For example, combining a longer acting medication with a short-acting nicotine replacement product may be beneficial. Talk to your health care provider about the right treatment for you. If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, you smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, or you're under age 18, talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter nicotine replacement products. Nicotine replacement therapy Nicotine replacement therapy gives you nicotine without tobacco and the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Nicotine replacement products help relieve withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The best time to start using nicotine replacement medication is on the date you've set to stop smoking. Some smokers start earlier in order to reduce smoking on their way to stopping altogether. The following nicotine replacement products are available over-the-counter: - Nicotine patch (NicoDerm CQ, Habitrol, others). The patch delivers nicotine through your skin and into your bloodstream. You wear a new patch each day. You typically use the patch for eight weeks or longer. If you haven't been able to stop smoking completely after two weeks of wearing the patch, ask your doctor about adjusting the dose or adding another nicotine replacement product. Common side effects include skin irritation, insomnia and vivid dreams. - Nicotine gum (Nicorette, others). This gum delivers nicotine to your blood through the lining of your mouth. Nicotine gum is often recommended to curb cravings. Chew the gum for a few times until you feel a mild tingling or peppery taste, then park the gum between your cheek and gumline for several minutes. This chewing and parking allows nicotine to be gradually absorbed in your bloodstream. Mouth irritation is a common side effect. Other side effects are often a result of overly vigorous chewing that releases nicotine too quickly. These include heartburn, nausea and hiccups. - Nicotine lozenge (Commit, Nicorette mini lozenge, others). This lozenge dissolves in your mouth and, like nicotine gum, delivers nicotine through the lining of your mouth. Place the lozenge in your mouth between your gumline and cheek or under your tongue and allow it to dissolve. You'll start with one lozenge every one to two hours and gradually increase the time between lozenges. Avoid drinking anything right before, while using or right after the lozenge. Side effects include mouth irritation as well as nicotine-related effects such as heartburn, nausea and hiccups. These nicotine replacement products are available by prescription: - Nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS). The nicotine in this product, sprayed directly into each nostril, is absorbed through your nasal membranes into your blood vessels. The nasal spray delivers nicotine a bit quicker than gum, lozenges or the patch, but not as rapidly as smoking a cigarette. It's usually prescribed for three-month periods for up to six months. Nasal and throat irritation, runny nose, sneezing and coughing are common side effects. - Nicotine inhaler (Nicotrol). This device is shaped something like a cigarette holder. You puff on it, and it delivers nicotine vapor into your mouth. You absorb the nicotine through the lining in your mouth, where it then enters your bloodstream. Common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and occasional coughing. Non-nicotine medications Medications that don't contain nicotine and are available by prescription include: - Bupropion (Zyban). The antidepressant drug bupropion increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, brain chemicals that are also boosted by nicotine. Typically your doctor will advise you to start bupropion one week before you stop smoking. Bupropion has the advantage of helping to minimize weight gain after you quit smoking. Common side effects include insomnia, agitation, headache and dry mouth. If you have a history of seizures or serious head trauma, such as a skull fracture, you shouldn't take this drug. - Varenicline (Chantix). This medication acts on the brain's nicotine receptors, decreasing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the feelings of pleasure you get from smoking. Typically your doctor will advise you to start varenicline one week before you stop smoking. Common side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia and vivid dreams. Rarely, varenicline has been associated with serious psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. - Nortriptyline (Pamelor). This medication may be prescribed if other medications haven't helped. This tricyclic antidepressant acts by increasing the levels of the brain neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Common side effects may include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation. Counseling, support groups and other programs Combining medications with behavioral counseling provides the best chance for establishing long-term smoking abstinence. Medications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms including tobacco craving, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to avoid tobacco over the long run. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be. Several types of counseling and support can help with stopping smoking: - Telephone counseling. No matter where you live, you can take advantage of phone counseling to help you give up tobacco. Every state in the U.S. has a telephone quit line, and some have more than one. To find the options in your state, call 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669). - Individual or group counseling program. Your doctor may recommend local support groups or a treatment program where counseling is provided by a tobacco treatment specialist. Counseling helps you learn techniques for preparing to stop smoking and provides support for you during the process. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs or have tobacco treatment specialists who are certified to provide treatment for nicotine dependence. Nicotine Anonymous groups are available in many locations to provide support for smokers trying to quit. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs - the most intensive treatment available. - Internet-based programs. Several websites offer support and strategies for people who want to stop smoking. BecomeAnEX is free and provides information and techniques as well as blogs, community forums, ask the expert and many other features. Text messaging services, including personalized reminders about a quit-smoking plan, also may prove helpful. Methods to avoid It's not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for cigarette smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe. Even products that deliver nicotine without tobacco are risky. Stick with proven stop-smoking aids and steer clear of the following products: - Dissolvable tobacco products. Tobacco pouches, lozenges, strips or other products contain small amounts of tobacco and nicotine you hold or dissolve in your mouth. There is no evidence they will help you stop smoking and little is known about their health effects. - E-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices that heat liquid containing nicotine into a vapor to be inhaled. Because these products are new, there isn't much data about possible safety risks. Studies of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation have shown mixed results. For these reasons, e-cigarettes aren't recommended for people trying to quit smoking. - Flavored cigarettes. Clove cigarettes (kreteks) and flavored cigarettes (bidis) carry the same health risks as smoking regular cigarettes and can cause additional health problems. Although they're banned in the United States, flavored cigarettes are available in other countries. - Hookahs (narghiles). These are water pipes that burn tobacco, and the smoke is inhaled through a hose. They are not safer than cigarettes. The water does not filter out toxins in the smoke, and the water and pipe have a risk of transmitting infections. - Nicotine lollipops and balms. Products containing nicotine salicylate are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and they pose a risk for accidental use by children. - Pipes and cigars. These products have similar, though less frequent, health risks as cigarettes, and they are not a safe alternative. - Smokeless tobacco and snuff (snus). These products contain nicotine in amounts similar to cigarettes and increase your risk of mouth and throat cancer, tooth and gum diseases, and other health problems. It's important to have a plan for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms are usually the most intense during the first week after you stop smoking. They may continue for several weeks, with declining intensity. Although most nicotine withdrawal symptoms pass within a month, you may occasionally experience a strong urge or craving to smoke months after stopping. Triggers or cues that were associated with your smoking can provoke these urges or cravings. Here's what you can do to help manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Regular physical activity has been found to reduce withdrawal symptoms and help people stop smoking. Exercise also helps avoid potential weight gain often associated with stopping. - Wait out cravings. Cravings or urges usually last less than five minutes. Wash the dishes, go for a walk or have a healthy snack, such as carrots, an apple or sunflower seeds, which will keep your mouth busy. Do something that keeps your hands busy, and before you know it, the urge will have passed. This is why you want to get rid of tobacco supplies when you decide to quit. You don't want to have any on hand when a craving hits. - Identify rationalizations. If you find yourself thinking, \"I'll just smoke one to get through this tough time\" or \"Just one won't hurt,\" recognize it as a message that can derail your plan. Review your reasons for quitting, and replace that thought with something positive to support your stopping. - Talk to a support person. If you're feeling anxious or depressed or need encouragement, a support person can help you get through a difficult craving. - Avoid high-risk situations. Know your triggers, and stay away from people, places and situations that tempt you to smoke. - Eat regular, healthy meals. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink more water. Many products claim to be smoking-cessation aids. Many also claim to be \"natural.\" Just remember that \"natural\" doesn't necessarily mean \"safe.\" Talk with your doctor before trying any alternative medicine treatments. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture involves stimulating points on the body, typically with thin, solid, metallic needles. Several studies have been conducted on the effects of acupuncture or acupressure for smoking cessation, but there's no definitive evidence that it works. - Herbs and supplements. A few studies have been conducted on the dietary supplements SAMe, silver acetate and St. John's wort for the treatment of tobacco dependence, but there is no current evidence that any natural product improves smoking cessation rates. - Hypnosis. Although no evidence supports the use of hypnosis - also called hypnotherapy - in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful. If you choose to pursue hypnosis, talk to your doctor about finding a reputable therapist. - Meditation. Although no evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful to reduce symptoms of anxiety.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Nicotine and tobacco: The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine. Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed. - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong. Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks. Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can: - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression - Increase activity in the intestines - Create more saliva and phlegm - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include: - Intense craving for nicotine - Anxiety - Depression - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping - Bad dreams and nightmares - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated - Headaches - Increased appetite and weight gain - Problems concentrating You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke. It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking. There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone. To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences. Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking. A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of: - Gum - Inhalers - Throat lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patches You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms. Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong. Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed. - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong. Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks. Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can: - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression - Increase activity in the intestines - Create more saliva and phlegm - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include: - Intense craving for nicotine - Anxiety - Depression - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping - Bad dreams and nightmares - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated - Headaches - Increased appetite and weight gain - Problems concentrating You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke. It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking. There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone. To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences. Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking. A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of: - Gum - Inhalers - Throat lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patches You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms. Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong. Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

Here's a comprehensive overview of how smoking tobacco affects the rest of the body:\n\n1. **Cardiovascular System**: Smoking damages the cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. It does this by damaging the inner lining of blood vessels, making them more susceptible to the accumulation of plaque (atherosclerosis), which can lead to blockages.\n\n2. **Brain**: Smoking affects the brain by increasing the risk of stroke and dementia. It also has links to cognitive decline and an increased risk of brain tumors, though the latter is less commonly discussed.\n\n3. **Eyes**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for eye diseases, including cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration, all of which can lead to vision loss.\n\n4. ** Mouth and Throat**: Tobacco use leads to oral health issues like gum disease, tooth loss, and mouth cancers (including tongue, lip, and throat cancer). It also causes bad breath, stains on teeth, and a reduced sense of taste and smell.\n\n5. **Digestive System**: Smoking increases the risk of various digestive disorders, including stomach ulcers, acid reflux, and liver disease. It can also affect the pancreas, increasing the risk of pancreatic cancer.\n\n6. **Skin**: Smoking accelerates aging of the skin, causing wrinkles, fine lines, and an uneven skin tone. It also reduces skin's elasticity, making it look saggy and less healthy.\n\n7. **Bones**: Tobacco use is associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis, as it interferes with blood supply and bone health. This can lead to a higher risk of fractures and osteoporotic compression fractures in the spine.\n\n8. **Reproductive System**: In women, smoking can lead to infertility, miscarriage, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In men, it can cause erectile dysfunction and reduced fertility.\n\n9. **Immune System**: Smoking weakens the immune system, making smokers more susceptible to infections like pneumonia and influenza. It also reduces the body's ability to fight off diseases, including cancer.\n\n10. **Hormonal System**: Smoking affects hormone production and regulation, including a potential impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes by affecting insulin sensitivity and secretion.\n\nGiven the data from the case series mentioned, where 27.0% of patients had a history of smoking, it's clear that smoking is a prevalent issue with significant health implications. The study highlights the importance of considering smoking history in the context of cardiac health and the potential for lung cancer, but the effects of smoking extend far beyond these areas, influencing nearly every system of the body. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce these risks and improve overall health, emphasizing the importance of smoking cessation efforts.",

          "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nhow smoking tobacco affects the rest of the body\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nSmoking tobacco has far-reaching effects on the entire body, extending beyond the lungs to impact various organs and systems. Here's a comprehensive overview of how smoking tobacco affects the rest of the body:\n\n1. **Cardiovascular System**: Smoking damages the cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. It does this by damaging the inner lining of blood vessels, making them more susceptible to the accumulation of plaque (atherosclerosis), which can lead to blockages.\n\n2. **Brain**: Smoking affects the brain by increasing the risk of stroke and dementia. It also has links to cognitive decline and an increased risk of brain tumors, though the latter is less commonly discussed.\n\n3. **Eyes**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for eye diseases, including cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration, all of which can lead to vision loss.\n\n4. ** Mouth and Throat**: Tobacco use leads to oral health issues like gum disease, tooth loss, and mouth cancers (including tongue, lip, and throat cancer). It also causes bad breath, stains on teeth, and a reduced sense of taste and smell.\n\n5. **Digestive System**: Smoking increases the risk of various digestive disorders, including stomach ulcers, acid reflux, and liver disease. It can also affect the pancreas, increasing the risk of pancreatic cancer.\n\n6. **Skin**: Smoking accelerates aging of the skin, causing wrinkles, fine lines, and an uneven skin tone. It also reduces skin's elasticity, making it look saggy and less healthy.\n\n7. **Bones**: Tobacco use is associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis, as it interferes with blood supply and bone health. This can lead to a higher risk of fractures and osteoporotic compression fractures in the spine.\n\n8. **Reproductive System**: In women, smoking can lead to infertility, miscarriage, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In men, it can cause erectile dysfunction and reduced fertility.\n\n9. **Immune System**: Smoking weakens the immune system, making smokers more susceptible to infections like pneumonia and influenza. It also reduces the body's ability to fight off diseases, including cancer.\n\n10. **Hormonal System**: Smoking affects hormone production and regulation, including a potential impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes by affecting insulin sensitivity and secretion.\n\nGiven the data from the case series mentioned, where 27.0% of patients had a history of smoking, it's clear that smoking is a prevalent issue with significant health implications. The study highlights the importance of considering smoking history in the context of cardiac health and the potential for lung cancer, but the effects of smoking extend far beyond these areas, influencing nearly every system of the body. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce these risks and improve overall health, emphasizing the importance of smoking cessation efforts.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nBenefits of quitting tobacco (Summary): If you smoke, you should quit. But quitting can be hard. Most people who have quit smoking have tried at least once, without success, in the past. View any past attempts to quit as a learning experience, not a failure. There are many reasons to quit using tobacco. Long-term use of tobacco can increase your risk of many serious health problems. THE BENEFITS OF QUITTING You may enjoy the following when you quit smoking. - Your breath, clothes, and hair will smell better. - Your sense of smell will return. Food will taste better. - Your fingers and fingernails will slowly appear less yellow. - Your stained teeth may slowly become whiter. - Your children will be healthier and will be less likely to start smoking. - It will be easier and cheaper to find an apartment or hotel room. - You may have an easier time getting a job. - Friends may be more willing to be in your car or home. - It may be easier to find a date. Many people do not smoke and do not like to be around people who smoke. - You will save money. If you smoke a pack a day, you spend about $2,000 a year on cigarettes. HEALTH BENEFITS Some health benefits begin almost immediately. Every week, month, and year without tobacco further improves your health. - Within 20 minutes of quitting: Your blood pressure and pulse rate drop to normal and the temperature of your hands and feet increases to normal. - Within 8 hours of quitting: Your blood carbon monoxide levels drop and your blood oxygen levels increase to normal levels. - Within 24 hours of quitting: Your risk of a sudden heart attack goes down. - Within 48 hours of quitting: Your nerve endings begin to regrow.

You will have fewer illnesses, colds, and asthma attacks. You will gradually no longer be short of breath with everyday activities. - Within 1 year of quitting: Your risk of coronary heart disease is half that of someone still using tobacco. - Within 5 years of quitting: Your risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder cancers are reduced by half. - Within 10 years of quitting: Your risk of dying from lung cancer is about one half that of a person who still smokes. Other health benefits of quitting smoking include: - Lower chance of blood clots in the legs, which may travel to the lungs - Lower risk of erectile dysfunction - Fewer problems during pregnancy, such as babies born at low birth weight, premature labor, miscarriage, and cleft lip - Lower risk of infertility due to damaged sperm - Healthier teeth, gums, and skin Infants and children who you live with will have: - Asthma that is easier to control - Fewer visits to the emergency room - Fewer colds, ear infections, and pneumonia - Reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) MAKING THE DECISION Like any addiction, quitting tobacco is difficult, especially if you do it alone.

Here are some steps and strategies to help manage anxiety:\n\n### 1. **Understand Your Anxiety**\n- **Identify Your Triggers:** Try to understand what causes your anxiety. Keeping a journal can help you track your feelings and the events that precede them.\n- **Learn About Anxiety:** Educating yourself about anxiety can help demystify it and make it feel less overwhelming.\n\n### 2. **Self-Care Techniques**\n- **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Practices like mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga can help reduce anxiety by teaching you how to stay in the present moment and manage your breath.\n- **Physical Activity:** Regular exercise can help reduce anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters.

Avoid sugary, caffeinated, and alcoholic beverages that can exacerbate anxiety.\n- **Sleep Hygiene:** Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Establish a bedtime routine to signal your body that it's time to sleep, and try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\n\n### 3. **Professional Help**\n- **Therapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for anxiety. It helps you understand your thought patterns and learn new ways of thinking and behaving.\n- **Medication:** If your anxiety is severe, your doctor may prescribe medication. Anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants can help manage symptoms.\n\n### 4. **Support Systems**\n- **Friends and Family:** Talking to someone you trust can provide emotional support and help you feel less isolated.\n- **Support Groups:** Joining a support group, either in person or online, can connect you with others who understand what you're going through.\n\n### 5. **Relaxation Techniques**\n- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** This involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body to release physical tension.\n- **Visualization:** Imagining yourself in a calm, safe space can help reduce feelings of anxiety.\n- **Grounding Techniques:** Using your senses to ground yourself in the present moment can help distract you from anxious thoughts.\n\n### 6. **Limit Stress**\n- **Set Boundaries:** Learn to say \"no\" to things that you don't have time for or that cause you stress.\n- **Time Management:** Prioritize tasks, break them down into manageable chunks, and take regular breaks to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\n### 7. **Seek Help When Needed**\n- If your anxiety is impacting your daily life, or if you're experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, seek help immediately. Call a helpline, talk to a trusted adult, or go to the emergency room.\n\nRemember, overcoming anxiety takes time and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for help. With the right tools and support, it's possible to manage anxiety and improve your quality of life.",

Here are some steps and considerations based on available research and general health guidelines:\n\n1. **Set Realistic Goals**: Define your weight loss goals. Aim for a slow and steady weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week. This might mean setting a goal of losing 5-10% of your current weight over the next 6-12 months.\n\n2. **Eat a Healthy Diet**: Focus on nutrient-dense foods, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Try to limit processed foods, sugars, and saturated fats. Drinking plenty of water and reducing sugary drinks can also help.\n\n3. **Increase Physical Activity**: Regular exercise not only burns calories but also helps build muscle mass, which further supports weight loss. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week. Incorporating strength training exercises at least twice a week can also be beneficial.\n\n4. **Consider Professional Guidance**: Sometimes, weight loss medications like GLP-1 receptor agonists may be prescribed for individuals with a BMI of 30 or higher or those with a BMI of 27 or higher who also have at least one weight-related condition such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol. These medications can help reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness, which can lead to weight loss. The study mentioned suggests that even after stopping GLP-1 medications, individuals with higher initial BMIs were more likely to maintain or continue their weight loss compared to those with lower BMIs.\n\n5. **Monitor Progress**: Regularly tracking your weight, measurements, and the food you eat can help you stay on track. Consider using a food diary or an app to monitor your calorie intake and physical activity.\n\n6. **Stay Consistent**: Weight loss and maintenance is a long-term process. It's crucial to find a balanced lifestyle that you can sustain over time, rather than looking for quick fixes.\n\n7. **Seek Support**: Having a support system, whether it's friends, family, or a support group, can significantly impact your success in losing weight and keeping it off.\n\nRemember, losing weight too quickly is not healthy. It's also important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any weight loss program, especially if you're considering medication or have health concerns. They can provide personalized advice and help you create a plan that suits your needs and health status.",

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the management of prostate cancer:\n\n**Understanding Prostate Cancer**\n\nProstate cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the prostate gland, a small walnut-sized gland in men that produces seminal fluid. It's essential to understand the different stages and types of prostate cancer, including:\n\n* Localized prostate cancer (cancer confined to the prostate gland)\n* Advanced prostate cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body)\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThe treatment options for prostate cancer depend on the stage, type, and overall health of the individual. Common treatment options include:\n\n1. **Active Surveillance**: Monitoring the cancer with regular check-ups, biopsies, and blood tests to determine if the cancer is growing.\n2. **Surgery**: Removing the prostate gland (prostatectomy) or surrounding tissues.\n3. **Radiation Therapy**: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.\n4. **Hormone Therapy**: Blocking the production of male hormones (androgens) that can fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n5. **Chemotherapy**: Using medications to kill cancer cells.\n6. **Immunotherapy**: Boosting the immune system to fight cancer cells.\n\n**Lifestyle Modifications**\n\nIn addition to medical treatment, making healthy lifestyle choices can help manage prostate cancer:\n\n1. **Eat a Balanced Diet**: Focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n2. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help flush out toxins.\n3. **Exercise Regularly**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day.\n4. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Excess weight can increase the risk of prostate cancer progression.\n5. **Manage Stress**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n**Emotional Support**\n\nProstate cancer can be emotionally challenging, so it's essential to seek support from:\n\n1. **Family and Friends**: Share your feelings and concerns with loved ones.\n2. **Support Groups**: Join online or in-person support groups to connect with others who are going through similar experiences.\n3. **Mental Health Professionals**: Consider seeking counseling or therapy to cope with anxiety, depression, or other emotional challenges.\n\n**Monitoring and Follow-up**\n\nRegular follow-up appointments with your healthcare team are crucial to monitor the progression of prostate cancer and adjust treatment plans as needed. Be sure to:\n\n1. **Keep Track of Your Symptoms**: Report any changes or new symptoms to your healthcare team.\n2. **Attend Scheduled Appointments**: Follow the recommended follow-up schedule to ensure timely monitoring and treatment adjustments.\n\nRemember, managing prostate cancer requires a collaborative effort between you, your healthcare team, and your loved ones. By understanding your treatment options, making healthy lifestyle choices, and seeking emotional support, you can navigate the challenges of prostate cancer and improve your overall well-being.",

Common treatment options include:\n\n1. **Active Surveillance**: Monitoring the cancer with regular check-ups, biopsies, and blood tests to determine if the cancer is growing.\n2. **Surgery**: Removing the prostate gland (prostatectomy) or surrounding tissues.\n3. **Radiation Therapy**: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.\n4. **Hormone Therapy**: Blocking the production of male hormones (androgens) that can fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n5. **Chemotherapy**: Using medications to kill cancer cells.\n6. **Immunotherapy**: Boosting the immune system to fight cancer cells.\n\n**Lifestyle Modifications**\n\nIn addition to medical treatment, making healthy lifestyle choices can help manage prostate cancer:\n\n1. **Eat a Balanced Diet**: Focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n2. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help flush out toxins.\n3. **Exercise Regularly**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day.\n4. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Excess weight can increase the risk of prostate cancer progression.\n5. **Manage Stress**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n**Emotional Support**\n\nProstate cancer can be emotionally challenging, so it's essential to seek support from:\n\n1. **Family and Friends**: Share your feelings and concerns with loved ones.\n2. **Support Groups**: Join online or in-person support groups to connect with others who are going through similar experiences.\n3. **Mental Health Professionals**: Consider seeking counseling or therapy to cope with anxiety, depression, or other emotional challenges.\n\n**Monitoring and Follow-up**\n\nRegular follow-up appointments with your healthcare team are crucial to monitor the progression of prostate cancer and adjust treatment plans as needed. Be sure to:\n\n1. **Keep Track of Your Symptoms**: Report any changes or new symptoms to your healthcare team.\n2. **Attend Scheduled Appointments**: Follow the recommended follow-up schedule to ensure timely monitoring and treatment adjustments.\n\nRemember, managing prostate cancer requires a collaborative effort between you, your healthcare team, and your loved ones. By understanding your treatment options, making healthy lifestyle choices, and seeking emotional support, you can navigate the challenges of prostate cancer and improve your overall well-being.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nProstate Cancer (Treatment Option Overview): - There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. - Seven types of standard treatment are used: - Watchful waiting or active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy - Hormone therapy - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - Bisphosphonate therapy - There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Cryosurgery - High-intensity-focused ultrasound therapy - Proton beam radiation therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Here are several strategies to help prevent atherosclerosis:\n\n1. **Maintain a Healthy Diet**: Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help keep your arteries healthy. Include foods that are known to help lower cholesterol and blood pressure, such as those high in omega-3 fatty acids (found in fatty fish), antioxidants (found in berries and leafy greens), and fiber (found in whole grains and many fruits and vegetables).\n\n2. **Exercise Regularly**: Physical activity can help improve circulation, lower blood pressure, and improve overall heart health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week.\n\n3. **Don't Smoke**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce your risk of developing this condition.\n\n4. **Limit Alcohol Consumption**: Excessive alcohol consumption can increase blood pressure and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Limit your alcohol intake to moderate levels, defined as up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.\n\n5. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Being overweight or obese can increase your risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, all of which are risk factors for atherosclerosis. Losing weight if you are overweight can help reduce these risks.\n\n6. **Manage Stress**: Chronic stress can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis by raising blood pressure and contributing to unhealthy behaviors such as overeating or smoking. Engage in stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n7. **Get Enough Sleep**: Poor sleep has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, including atherosclerosis. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n\n8. **Monitor and Manage Blood Pressure**: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Have your blood pressure checked regularly and work with your healthcare provider to manage it if it is high.\n\n9. **Monitor and Manage Cholesterol Levels**: High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Have your cholesterol levels checked and work with your healthcare provider to manage them if they are high.\n\n10. **Manage Diabetes**: If you have diabetes, keeping your blood sugar levels under control can help reduce your risk of developing atherosclerosis. Work closely with your healthcare provider to manage your diabetes.\n\n11. **Limit Sodium Intake**: Consuming too much sodium can increase blood pressure. Limit your sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams a day, and further reduce it to less than 1,500 milligrams if you are at risk for high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nBy following these steps, you can reduce your risk of developing atherosclerosis and promote overall heart health. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new diet or exercise program, especially if you have existing health conditions.",

Here's a comprehensive guide to help you reduce your risk of developing diabetes:\n\n**Lifestyle Modifications:**\n\n1. **Maintain a healthy weight**: Being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Losing weight, if you're overweight, can help you prevent or delay the onset of diabetes.\n2. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid sugary drinks, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats.\n3. **Stay physically active**: Regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, can help you maintain a healthy weight, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce your risk of developing diabetes.\n4. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate your blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.\n5. **Manage stress**: Chronic stress can raise your blood sugar levels and increase your risk of developing diabetes. Engage in stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n**Dietary Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Choose whole grains**: Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread can help regulate your blood sugar levels.\n2. **Incorporate diabetes-friendly foods**: Foods like leafy greens, citrus fruits, and fatty fish (like salmon) have been shown to help prevent diabetes.\n3. **Limit sugary drinks and refined carbohydrates**: Avoid sugary drinks, white bread, and other refined carbohydrates that can cause a spike in blood sugar levels.\n4. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help regulate your blood sugar levels.\n\n**Medical Interventions:**\n\n1. **Get regular check-ups**: Regular health check-ups can help identify risk factors and detect diabetes early, when it's more treatable.\n2. **Monitor your blood sugar levels**: If you're at high risk of developing diabetes, your doctor may recommend regular blood sugar monitoring to track your levels.\n3. **Consider medications**: In some cases, medications like metformin may be prescribed to help prevent diabetes in people with prediabetes or other risk factors.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Don't smoke**: Smoking can increase your risk of developing diabetes, so quitting or avoiding tobacco products altogether is crucial.\n2. **Limit alcohol consumption**: Excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of developing diabetes, so limit your intake to moderate levels (up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men).\n3. **Get enough vitamin D**: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes, so ensure you're getting enough through sunlight, supplements, or fortified foods.\n\nBy following these tips and making healthy lifestyle choices, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Remember to consult with your healthcare provider before making any significant changes to your lifestyle or medication regimen.",

Here are some key strategies to reduce your risk of developing lung cancer:\n\n1. **Quit Smoking**: The most significant risk factor for lung cancer is smoking. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce your risk of developing lung cancer. There are many resources available to help you quit, including counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and prescription medications.\n\n2. **Avoid Secondhand Smoke**: Being around others who smoke can increase your risk of developing lung cancer. Avoid exposure to secondhand smoke by staying away from areas where people are smoking and encouraging loved ones to quit.\n\n3. **Radon Testing and Mitigation**: Radon is a radioactive gas that can accumulate in buildings and is a known cause of lung cancer. Have your home tested for radon, and if levels are high, take steps to reduce them, such as sealing entry points and installing a radon mitigation system.\n\n4. **Avoid Exposure to Asbestos and Other Carcinogens**: Asbestos, arsenic, and certain chemicals used in industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing can increase lung cancer risk. If you work with these substances, follow safety guidelines and wear protective gear to minimize exposure.\n\n5. **Healthy Diet and Exercise**: Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise, can help support overall health and may reduce lung cancer risk.\n\n6. **Stay Up-to-Date on Screenings and Check-Ups**: For individuals at high risk, such as current or former smokers, annual lung cancer screening with a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan may be recommended. Discuss your risk factors and the potential benefits and risks of screening with your healthcare provider.\n\n7. **Limit Exposure to Air Pollution**: Long-term exposure to polluted air can increase the risk of lung cancer. Check local air quality indexes and try to limit your time outdoors when pollution levels are high. Supporting policies and practices that reduce air pollution can also contribute to a healthier environment.\n\n8. **Get Vaccinated Against Infections**: Certain infections, like pneumonia, can increase the risk of lung cancer. Staying up-to-date on recommended vaccinations can help prevent these infections.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing lung cancer. Remember, prevention is key, and making healthy choices can have a profound impact on your overall health and well-being. If you have concerns about your lung health or risk factors for lung cancer, consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.",

Here are some steps that may help reduce the risk of schizophrenia or alleviate its symptoms:\n\n1. **Genetic counseling**: If you have a family history of schizophrenia, consider genetic counseling to understand your risks and the potential implications for your family.\n2. **Prenatal care**: Proper prenatal care can help identify and manage potential risk factors, such as maternal infections or nutritional deficiencies, that may contribute to the development of schizophrenia in the fetus.\n3. **Healthy lifestyle**: Engage in regular exercise, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep to help maintain overall mental and physical health.\n4. **Substance abuse prevention**: Avoid using illicit substances, such as cannabis, cocaine, or amphetamines, which can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia or exacerbate its symptoms.\n5. **Stress management**: Practice stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, to help cope with stress and anxiety.\n6. **Social connections**: Build and maintain strong social relationships and connections with family and friends to help reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness.\n7. **Cognitive training**: Engage in activities that challenge the brain, such as puzzles, games, or learning a new skill, to help build cognitive reserve and potentially reduce the risk of cognitive decline.\n8. **Early intervention**: If you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, seek professional help as early as possible. Early intervention can help alleviate symptoms, improve treatment outcomes, and reduce the risk of long-term disability.\n9. **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Some research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, may have a protective effect against schizophrenia. Food sources include fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts.\n10. **Vitamin D**: Maintain adequate vitamin D levels, as some studies suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of schizophrenia.\n\nIt is essential to note that schizophrenia is a complex condition, and while these steps may help reduce the risk or alleviate symptoms, they are not a guarantee against developing the condition. If you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, consult a qualified healthcare professional for proper diagnosis, treatment, and support.\n\n**Important medical details:**\n\n* Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health condition characterized by disruptions in thought processes, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions.\n* The exact causes of schizophrenia are still not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors.\n* Symptoms of schizophrenia can include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms such as apathy or social withdrawal.\n* Treatment for schizophrenia typically involves a combination of medications, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\n**Remember:** If you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, it is crucial to seek professional help from a qualified healthcare provider. Early intervention and treatment can significantly improve outcomes and reduce the risk of long-term disability.",

Early intervention can help alleviate symptoms, improve treatment outcomes, and reduce the risk of long-term disability.\n9. **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Some research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, may have a protective effect against schizophrenia. Food sources include fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts.\n10. **Vitamin D**: Maintain adequate vitamin D levels, as some studies suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of schizophrenia.\n\nIt is essential to note that schizophrenia is a complex condition, and while these steps may help reduce the risk or alleviate symptoms, they are not a guarantee against developing the condition.

              "text": "Heart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program."

Provide the operator with as much information as possible, including the location and any symptoms.\n2. **Stay Calm**: Try to remain calm and still, as this can help reduce the workload on the heart.\n3. **Loosen Tight Clothing**: Loosen any tight clothing, especially around the neck and chest, to help improve blood flow.\n4. **Administer Aspirin (if directed)**: If the emergency operator or a healthcare professional instructs you to do so, give the person having the heart attack an aspirin (325 mg) to chew and swallow. This can help prevent further clotting.\n\n**Medical Treatment:**\n\n1. **Get to the Hospital**: The person having the heart attack will be transported to the hospital, where they will receive immediate medical attention.\n2. **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)**: A healthcare professional will perform an ECG to assess the heart's electrical activity and determine the extent of the damage.\n3. **Cardiac Catheterization**: A cardiac catheterization may be performed to open blocked arteries and restore blood flow to the heart.\n4. **Medications**: The person may receive medications to:\n\t* Dissolve blood clots (thrombolytics)\n\t* Prevent further clotting (anticoagulants)\n\t* Reduce blood pressure (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors)\n\t* Relieve pain and anxiety (morphine, nitroglycerin)\n5. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace damaged blood vessels or heart tissue.\n\n**Long-term Treatment and Recovery:**\n\n1. **Cardiac Rehabilitation**: A cardiac rehabilitation program can help the person recover and manage their condition through lifestyle modifications, exercise, and education.\n2. **Medications**: The person may need to take medications long-term to manage their condition, such as:\n\t* Blood thinners (aspirin, warfarin)\n\t* Beta blockers\n\t* ACE inhibitors\n\t* Statins (to lower cholesterol)\n3. **Lifestyle Changes**: Making healthy lifestyle changes, such as:\n\t* Quitting smoking\n\t* Exercising regularly\n\t* Eating a heart-healthy diet\n\t* Managing stress\n\t* Getting regular check-ups with a healthcare professional\n\nRemember, prompt medical attention is crucial in treating a heart attack.

              "text": "Autoimmune disorders: An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune disorders. The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances. When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues. The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder may result in: - The destruction of body tissue - Abnormal growth of an organ - Changes in organ function An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include: - Blood vessels - Connective tissues - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas - Joints - Muscles - Red blood cells - Skin A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include: - Addison disease - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) - Dermatomyositis - Graves disease - Hashimoto thyroiditis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Pernicious anemia - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sj\u00f6gren syndrome - Systemic lupus erythematosus - Type I diabetes Symptoms will vary based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include: - Fatigue - Fever - General ill-feeling (malaise) - Joint pain - Rash The health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease. Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include: - Antinuclear antibody tests - Autoantibody tests - CBC - Comprehensive metabolic panel - C-reactive protein (CRP) - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) - Urinalysis The goals of treatment are to: - Reduce symptoms - Control the autoimmune process - Maintain the body's ability to fight disease Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include: - Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease - Blood transfusions if blood is affected - Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are often called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TFN) blockers can be used for some diseases. The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic, but many can be controlled with treatment. Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk of infections. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders. Updated by: Laura J.

              "text": "Pancreatic cancer: Pancreatic cancer is cancer that starts in the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach. It makes and releases enzymes into the intestines that help the body digest and absorb food, especially fats. The pancreas also makes and releases insulin and glucagon. These are hormones that help the body control blood sugar levels. There are different types of pancreatic cancers. The type depends on the cell the cancer develops in. Examples include: - Adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer - Other more rare types include glucagonoma, insulinoma, islet cell tumor, VIPoma The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. It is more common in persons who: - Are obese - Have a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables - Have diabetes - Have long-term exposure to certain chemicals - Have long-term inflammation of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) - Smoke Pancreatic cancer is slightly more common in women than in men. The risk increases with age. Family history of the disease also slightly increases the chance of developing this cancer. A tumor (cancer) in the pancreas may grow without any symptoms at first. This means the cancer is often advanced when it is first found. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: - Diarrhea - Dark urine and clay-colored stools - Fatigue and weakness - Sudden increase in blood sugar level (diabetes) - Jaundice (a yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes) and itching of the skin - Loss of appetite and weight loss - Nausea and vomiting - Pain or discomfort in the upper part of the belly or abdomen The doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. During the exam, the doctor may feel a lump (mass) in your abdomen. Blood tests that may be ordered include: - Complete blood count (CBC) - Liver function tests - Serum bilirubin Imaging tests that may be ordered include: - CT scan of the abdomen - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - Endoscopic ultrasound - MRI of the abdomen Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (and what type) is made by a pancreatic biopsy. If tests confirm you have pancreatic cancer, more tests will be done to see how far the cancer has spread within and outside the pancreas. This is called staging. Staging helps guide treatment and gives you an idea of what to expect. Treatment for adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor. Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach. When the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended. When the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used. With advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the tube that carries bile is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage. This can help relieve loss of appetite, jaundice, and itching of the skin. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Some people with pancreatic cancer that can be surgically removed are cured. But in most people, the tumor has spread and cannot be completely removed at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy and radiation are often given after surgery to increase the cure rate (this is called adjuvant therapy). For pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed completely with surgery or cancer that has spread beyond the pancreas, a cure is not possible. In this case, chemotherapy is given to improve and extend one's life. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have: - Abdominal pain that does not go away - Back pain - Loss of appetite - Unexplained fatigue or weight loss - Other symptoms of this disorder Preventive measures include: - If you smoke, now is the time to quit. - Keep a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. - Exercise regularly to stay at a healthy weight.

              "text": "Klinefelter syndrome (Treatment): If you or your son is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, your health care team may include a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders involving the body's glands and hormones (endocrinologist), a speech therapist, a pediatrician, a physical therapist, a genetic counselor, a reproductive medicine or infertility specialist, and a counselor or psychologist. Although there's no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it's never too late to get help. Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome may include: - Testosterone replacement therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone replacement can be given to help stimulate changes that normally occur at puberty, such as developing a deeper voice, growing facial and body hair, and increasing muscle mass and penis size. Testosterone therapy can also improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It will not result in testicle enlargement or improve infertility. - Breast tissue removal. In males who develop enlarged breasts, excess breast tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, leaving a more normal-looking chest. - Speech and physical therapy. These treatments can help boys with Klinefelter syndrome overcome problems with speech, language and muscle weakness. - Educational evaluation and support. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have trouble learning and socializing and can benefit from extra assistance. Talk to your child's teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support might help. - Fertility treatment. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to father children because few or no sperm are produced in the testicles. For some men with minimal sperm production, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is removed from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg. - Psychological counseling. Having Klinefelter syndrome can be a challenge, especially during puberty and young adulthood. For men with the condition, coping with infertility can be difficult. A family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help work through the emotional issues."

However, I can provide information on the treatments available for Klinefelter's syndrome.\n\nKlinefelter's syndrome is a genetic condition that affects males, where they are born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). This condition can lead to various physical, hormonal, and reproductive issues. Here are some treatments available to males with Klinefelter's syndrome:\n\n1. **Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT):** This is the primary treatment for Klinefelter's syndrome. TRT helps to increase testosterone levels, which can improve muscle mass, bone density, and overall physical development. It can also help to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and improve sexual function.\n2. **Speech and Language Therapy:** Some individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome may experience speech and language difficulties. Speech therapy can help improve communication skills and address any related issues.\n3. **Physical Therapy:** Physical therapy can help improve physical strength, coordination, and balance. It can also help address any musculoskeletal issues associated with the condition.\n4. **Psychological Counseling:** Klinefelter's syndrome can affect an individual's self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Psychological counseling can help individuals cope with these emotional challenges and develop strategies to manage their condition.\n5. **Fertility Treatment:** While males with Klinefelter's syndrome may experience infertility, there are fertility treatments available, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). These treatments can help individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome father children.\n6. **Surgical Interventions:** In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary to address physical characteristics associated with Klinefelter's syndrome, such as gynecomastia (breast tissue growth).\n7. **Educational Support:** Individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome may require educational support to address learning difficulties or developmental delays. This can include special education programs or accommodations in the classroom.\n8. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management, can help individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome manage their condition and reduce the risk of associated health problems.\n\nIt is essential for individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome to work with a healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their unique needs and health goals. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with this condition.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nKlinefelter syndrome (Treatment): If you or your son is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, your health care team may include a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders involving the body's glands and hormones (endocrinologist), a speech therapist, a pediatrician, a physical therapist, a genetic counselor, a reproductive medicine or infertility specialist, and a counselor or psychologist. Although there's no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it's never too late to get help. Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome may include: - Testosterone replacement therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone replacement can be given to help stimulate changes that normally occur at puberty, such as developing a deeper voice, growing facial and body hair, and increasing muscle mass and penis size. Testosterone therapy can also improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It will not result in testicle enlargement or improve infertility. - Breast tissue removal. In males who develop enlarged breasts, excess breast tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, leaving a more normal-looking chest. - Speech and physical therapy. These treatments can help boys with Klinefelter syndrome overcome problems with speech, language and muscle weakness. - Educational evaluation and support. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have trouble learning and socializing and can benefit from extra assistance. Talk to your child's teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support might help. - Fertility treatment. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to father children because few or no sperm are produced in the testicles. For some men with minimal sperm production, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is removed from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg. - Psychological counseling. Having Klinefelter syndrome can be a challenge, especially during puberty and young adulthood. For men with the condition, coping with infertility can be difficult. A family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help work through the emotional issues.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The gallbladder is a small organ located under the liver that stores bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver. Bile helps break down fats and absorb fat-soluble vitamins. If the gallbladder is not functioning properly, it can lead to various symptoms. Here are some common symptoms of a nonfunctioning gallbladder:\n\n1. **Pain in the upper right abdomen**: This is one of the most common symptoms of a nonfunctioning gallbladder. The pain can be constant or intermittent, and it may worsen after eating fatty or greasy foods.\n2. **Nausea and vomiting**: People with a nonfunctioning gallbladder may experience nausea and vomiting, especially after eating.\n3. **Indigestion and bloating**: A nonfunctioning gallbladder can cause indigestion, bloating, and discomfort in the upper abdomen.\n4. **Gas and flatulence**: Inability to digest fats properly can lead to an increase in gas and flatulence.\n5. **Diarrhea or constipation**: A nonfunctioning gallbladder can cause changes in bowel movements, leading to diarrhea or constipation.\n6. **Fatty stool**: Undigested fats can pass into the stool, making it appear greasy or fatty.\n7. **Loss of appetite**: People with a nonfunctioning gallbladder may experience a decrease in appetite, especially for fatty or greasy foods.\n8. **Weight loss**: Unintentional weight loss can occur if the gallbladder is not functioning properly, as the body may not be able to absorb nutrients and fats effectively.\n9. **Jaundice**: In severe cases, a nonfunctioning gallbladder can cause jaundice, which is characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes.\n\nIt is essential to note that some people with a nonfunctioning gallbladder may not exhibit any symptoms at all.

Some of the main causes of childhood obesity include:\n\n1. **Genetics**: Children are more likely to be obese if one or both of their parents are obese. Genetic factors can affect appetite, metabolism, and body composition.\n2. **Diet**: Consuming high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sugar foods and drinks, such as fast food, sugary snacks, and sweetened beverages, can lead to weight gain and obesity.\n3. **Lack of physical activity**: Sedentary behaviors, such as watching TV, playing video games, and using electronic devices, can contribute to a lack of physical activity and increased risk of obesity.\n4. **Socioeconomic factors**: Children from low-income families or those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods may have limited access to healthy food options, safe spaces for physical activity, and healthcare resources.\n5. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to environmental toxins, such as pesticides and air pollution, has been linked to an increased risk of obesity in children.\n6. **Psychological factors**: Emotional eating, stress, and anxiety can lead to overeating and poor food choices, contributing to weight gain and obesity.\n7. **Lack of sleep**: Children who do not get enough sleep or have poor sleep quality may be more likely to be obese, as sleep deprivation can disrupt hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism.\n8. **Certain medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can increase the risk of obesity in children.\n9. **Medications**: Some medications, such as steroids and certain antidepressants, can cause weight gain and increase the risk of obesity.\n10. **Lack of breastfeeding**: Formula-fed infants may be more likely to be obese later in childhood, as breastfeeding has been shown to have a protective effect against obesity.\n\nIt's essential to note that childhood obesity is often the result of a combination of these factors, rather than a single cause. Addressing childhood obesity requires a comprehensive approach that involves families, communities, schools, and healthcare providers working together to promote healthy habits, environments, and lifestyles.\n\n**Prevention and intervention strategies**:\n\n* Encourage healthy eating habits, such as consuming plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n* Support regular physical activity, such as playing sports, dancing, or simply playing outside.\n* Limit screen time and promote outdoor play.\n* Ensure children get enough sleep (8-12 hours for school-age children).\n* Encourage mindful eating and self-regulation of food intake.\n* Foster a positive body image and self-esteem.\n* Provide access to healthcare resources and support for families and communities.\n\nBy understanding the causes of childhood obesity and working together to promote healthy habits and environments, we can help prevent and address this critical public health issue.",

            "text": "Tooth loss, also known as edentulism, can occur due to a variety of reasons. The main causes can be broadly categorized into several key areas:\n\n1. **Periodontal Disease**: This is one of the leading causes of tooth loss in adults. Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, is an infection of the gums that can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth, creating pockets that can become infected. If left untreated, it can lead to the destruction of the tissue and bone that support the teeth, resulting in tooth loss.\n\n2. **Tooth Decay**: Tooth decay, also known as dental caries, occurs when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria, forms on the teeth and starts to eat away at the enamel and dentin, leading to cavities. If cavities are left untreated, they can progress to the point where the tooth becomes non-restorable and must be extracted.\n\n3. **Trauma or Injury**: Physical trauma to the mouth, such as from a fall, sports injury, or car accident, can cause teeth to become chipped, cracked, or completely dislodged from the socket. The severity of the injury often dictates whether the tooth can be saved or if extraction is necessary.\n\n4. **Gum Recession**: Gum recession is the process where the gum tissue around the teeth pulls back and exposes more of the tooth and the root. While gum recession itself is not a direct cause of tooth loss, it can make the teeth more susceptible to decay and sensitivity, potentially leading to conditions that necessitate tooth extraction.\n\n5. **Poor Dental Hygiene**: Not practicing regular and proper dental hygiene can lead to both periodontal disease and tooth decay. Brushing and flossing help remove plaque and food particles that can contribute to tooth and gum problems.\n\n6. **Smoking and Tobacco Use**: Smoking and using tobacco products are risk factors for periodontal disease and tooth decay. Tobacco reduces blood flow to the gums, making them more susceptible to disease, and it also affects the healing process, making it harder for the gums to recover from disease or injury.\n\n7. **Genetics**: Some individuals may be more prone to tooth loss due to genetic factors. For example, a person may inherit a tendency to have weaker teeth or gums, making them more susceptible to conditions that lead to tooth loss.\n\n8. **Nutritional Factors**: A diet high in sugar and acids, along with low levels of essential nutrients, can increase the risk of tooth decay and periodontal disease. Nutrients like calcium and vitamin D are crucial for maintaining healthy teeth and gums.\n\n9. **Systemic Diseases**: Certain systemic diseases, such as diabetes, can increase the risk of periodontal disease and tooth loss. These diseases can impair the body's ability to fight off infections, including those in the mouth.\n\n10. **Age**: Tooth loss is more common in older adults due to the cumulative effects of years of wear and tear on the teeth, along with potential decreases in dental care and health over time.\n\nPreventing tooth loss involves a combination of good oral hygiene practices (including regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups), a healthy diet, avoidance of tobacco products, and early intervention in the case of dental problems. Regular dental care can help identify issues before they become severe, potentially saving teeth and preventing tooth loss.",

              "text": "What are the symptoms of Prostate Cancer?: Symptoms Most cancers in their early, most treatable stages don't cause any symptoms. Early prostate cancer usually does not cause symptoms. However, if prostate cancer develops and is not treated, it can cause these symptoms: - a need to urinate frequently, especially at night - difficulty starting urination or holding back urine - inability to urinate - weak or interrupted flow of urine - painful or burning urination - difficulty in having an erection - painful ejaculation - blood in urine or semen - pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. a need to urinate frequently, especially at night difficulty starting urination or holding back urine inability to urinate weak or interrupted flow of urine painful or burning urination difficulty in having an erection painful ejaculation blood in urine or semen pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. Any of these symptoms may be caused by cancer, but more often they are due to enlargement of the prostate, which is not cancer. If You Have Symptoms If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a urologist to find out if you need treatment. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the genitourinary system. The doctor will ask questions about your medical history and perform an exam to try to find the cause of the prostate problems. The PSA Test The doctor may also suggest a blood test to check your prostate specific antigen, or PSA, level. PSA levels can be high not only in men who have prostate cancer, but also in men with an enlarged prostate gland and men with infections of the prostate. PSA tests may be very useful for early cancer diagnosis. However, PSA tests alone do not always tell whether or not cancer is present. PSA screening for prostate cancer is not perfect. (Screening tests check for disease in a person who shows no symptoms.) Most men with mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer, and many men with prostate cancer have normal levels of PSA. A recent study revealed that men with low prostate specific antigen levels, or PSA, may still have prostate cancer. Also, the digital rectal exam can miss many prostate cancers. Other Tests The doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. But to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. During a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. If Cancer is Present If a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. Doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope. One way of grading prostate cancer, called the Gleason system, uses scores of 2 to 10. Another system uses G1 through G4. The higher the score, the higher the grade of the tumor. High-grade tumors grow more quickly and are more likely to spread than low-grade tumors."

              "text": "Headache (Causes): The most common type of headache is tension headache. It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. A tension headache: - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. - Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore. A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine: - The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. It may spread to both sides. - The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around. - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache. Other types of headaches: - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning. - Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome. - Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area. In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something more serious, such as: - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) - Blood pressure that is very high - Brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, or abscess - Brain tumor - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Lack of oxygen during sleep (sleep apnea) - Problems with the blood vessels and bleeding in the brain, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain aneurysm, or stroke"

The most common types of primary headaches include:\n\n1. **Tension Headaches**: These are the most common type of headache and are often described as a dull, aching sensation on both sides of the head. They are usually caused by muscle tension in the neck and scalp, and can be triggered by stress, fatigue, and poor posture.\n2. **Migraines**: These are severe, throbbing headaches that can be accompanied by sensitivity to light, sound, and nausea. Migraines are thought to be caused by changes in blood flow and nerve activity in the brain.\n3. **Cluster Headaches**: These are severe, one-sided headaches that occur in clusters or cycles. They are often accompanied by nasal congestion, eye watering, and swelling.\n\n**Secondary Headaches:**\nThese are headaches that are caused by an underlying medical condition. Some common causes of secondary headaches include:\n\n1. **Sinusitis**: Inflammation or infection of the sinuses can cause headaches, facial pain, and nasal congestion.\n2. **Eye Strain**: Prolonged use of computers, reading, or other activities that cause eye strain can lead to headaches.\n3. **Dental Problems**: Toothaches, gum disease, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders can all cause headaches.\n4. **High Blood Pressure**: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause headaches, as well as other symptoms such as dizziness and nausea.\n5. **Infections**: Infections such as meningitis, encephalitis, and sinusitis can all cause headaches.\n6. **Medication Overuse**: Taking too many painkillers or other medications can cause rebound headaches.\n7. **Hormonal Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause can cause headaches.\n8. **Sleep Disorders**: Sleep apnea, insomnia, and other sleep disorders can cause headaches.\n9. **Stress and Anxiety**: Stress and anxiety can cause tension headaches, as well as exacerbate other types of headaches.\n10. **Trauma**: Head injuries, such as concussions, can cause headaches.\n\n**Other Possible Causes:**\nOther possible causes of headaches include:\n\n1. **Food and Drink**: Certain foods and drinks, such as caffeine, chocolate, and alcohol, can trigger headaches in some people.\n2. **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to loud noises, bright lights, and changes in weather or altitude can all cause headaches.\n3. **Genetics**: A family history of headaches can increase a person's risk of developing headaches.\n\nIt's essential to note that if you experience frequent, severe, or persistent headaches, you should consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and develop an effective treatment plan.",

It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. A tension headache: - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. - Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore. A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine: - The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. It may spread to both sides. - The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around. - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache. Other types of headaches: - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning. - Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome. - Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area. In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something more serious, such as: - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) - Blood pressure that is very high - Brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, or abscess - Brain tumor - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Lack of oxygen during sleep (sleep apnea) - Problems with the blood vessels and bleeding in the brain, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain aneurysm, or stroke\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH.

              "text": "Hypoglycemia (Causes): Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low. There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria. - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia. - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia. - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery."

There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria. - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia. - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia. - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Pneumonia (Causes): Bacteria, viruses, and fungi infections can cause pneumonia. These infections cause inflammation in the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs. This inflammation causes the air sacs to fill with fluid and pus. Bacteria Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Many types of bacteria can cause bacterial pneumonia. Streptococcus\u00a0pneumoniae or pneumococcus bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the United States. If your pneumonia is caused by one of the following types of bacteria, it is called atypical pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila.\u00a0This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains. Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\u00a0This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However,\u00a0Mycoplasma pneumoniae\u00a0can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis. This type of bacteria is a common cause of \u201cwalking pneumonia\u201d. Chlamydia pneumoniae.\u00a0This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a viral cold or the flu. Bacterial pneumonia often affects just one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia. Read more Most of the time, the body filters bacteria out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system, the shape of your nose and throat, your ability to\u00a0cough, and fine, hair-like structures called cilia help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. Read How the Lungs Work for more information. Sometimes bacteria manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if: Your immune system is weak A germ is very strong Your body fails to filter out the bacteria from the air that you breathe. For example, if you can't cough because you've had a\u00a0stroke\u00a0or are sedated, bacteria may remain in your airways. When bacteria reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the bacteria. These cells cause inflammation in alveoli (air sacs) and can cause these spaces to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia. Viruses Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. The influenza or flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in children younger than one year old. \u00a0Other viruses can cause pneumonia such as the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about one to three weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia. Fungi Pneumocystis pneumonia is a serious fungal infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. It occurs in people who have weak immune systems due to HIV/AIDS or the long-term use of medicines that suppress their immune systems, such as those used to treat cancer or as part of organ or\u00a0blood and marrow stem cell transplant procedures. Other fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia. The following are three fungi that occur in the soil in some parts of the United States and can cause some people to get pneumonia. Coccidioidomycosis. This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest. It is the cause of valley fever. Histoplasmosis. This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. Cryptococcus. This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings."

              "text": "Chronic kidney disease: Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include: - Nausea - Vomiting - Loss of appetite - Fatigue and weakness - Sleep problems - Changes in how much you urinate - Decreased mental sharpness - Muscle twitches and cramps - Swelling of feet and ankles - Persistent itching - Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart - Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs - High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: - Type 1 or type 2 diabetes - High blood pressure - Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli) - Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures - Polycystic kidney disease - Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers - Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys - Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis) Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: - Diabetes - High blood pressure - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Smoking - Obesity - Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American - Family history of kidney disease - Abnormal kidney structure - Older age Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include: - Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) - A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures - Anemia - Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility - Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures - Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection - Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium) - Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus - Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival As a first step toward diagnosis of kidney disease, your doctor discusses your personal and family history with you. Among other things, your doctor might ask questions about whether you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, if you've taken a medication that might affect kidney function, if you've noticed changes in your urinary habits, and whether you have any family members who have kidney disease. Next, your doctor performs a physical exam, also checking for signs of problems with your heart or blood vessels, and conducts a neurological exam. For kidney disease diagnosis, you may also need certain tests and procedures, such as: - Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood. - Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases. - Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle that's inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what's causing your kidney problem. Depending on the underlying cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure. Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you may need treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Treating the cause Your doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary, depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, has been controlled. Treating complications Kidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments may include: - High blood pressure medications. People with kidney disease may experience worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend medications to lower your blood pressure - commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers - and to preserve kidney function. High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you may need frequent blood tests to monitor your condition. Your doctor will likely also recommend a water pill (diuretic) and a low-salt diet. - Medications to lower cholesterol levels. Your doctor may recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often experience high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease. - Medications to treat anemia. In certain situations, your doctor may recommend supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron. Erythropoietin supplements aid in production of more red blood cells, which may relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia. - Medications to relieve swelling. People with chronic kidney disease may retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs, as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body. - Medications to protect your bones. Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You may also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood, and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification). - A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood. As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor may recommend eating less protein. Your doctor may also ask you to meet with a dietitian who can suggest ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet. Your doctor may recommend follow-up testing at regular intervals to see whether your kidney disease remains stable or progresses. Treatment for end-stage kidney disease If your kidneys can't keep up with waste and fluid clearance on their own and you develop complete or near-complete kidney failure, you have end-stage kidney disease. At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. - Dialysis. Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood. In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube (catheter) inserted into your abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a period of time, the dialysis solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it. - Kidney transplant. A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can come from deceased or living donors. You'll need to take medications for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ. You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant. For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option is to treat kidney failure with conservative measures. However, once you have complete kidney failure, your life expectancy generally would be only a few months. Potential future treatments Regenerative medicine holds the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that today are beyond repair. Regenerative medicine approaches include: - Boosting the body's natural ability to heal itself - Using healthy cells, tissues or organs from a living or deceased donor to replace damaged ones - Delivering specific types of cells or cell products to diseased tissues or organs to restore tissue and organ function For people with chronic kidney disease, regenerative medicine approaches may be developed in the future to help slow progression of the disease. As part of your treatment for chronic kidney disease, your doctor may recommend a special diet to help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian who can analyze your current diet and suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys. Depending on your situation, kidney function and overall health, your dietitian may recommend that you: - Avoid products with added salt. Lower the amount of sodium you eat each day by avoiding products with added salt, including many convenience foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses. - Choose lower potassium foods. Your dietitian may recommend that you choose lower potassium foods at each meal. High-potassium foods include bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Examples of low-potassium foods include apples, cabbage, carrots, green beans, grapes and strawberries. Be aware that many salt substitutes contain potassium, so you generally should avoid them if you have kidney failure. - Limit the amount of protein you eat. Your dietitian will estimate the appropriate number of grams of protein you need each day and make recommendations based on that amount. High-protein foods include lean meats, eggs, milk, cheese and beans. Low-protein foods include vegetables, fruits, breads and cereals."

Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include: - Nausea - Vomiting - Loss of appetite - Fatigue and weakness - Sleep problems - Changes in how much you urinate - Decreased mental sharpness - Muscle twitches and cramps - Swelling of feet and ankles - Persistent itching - Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart - Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs - High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: - Type 1 or type 2 diabetes - High blood pressure - Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli) - Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures - Polycystic kidney disease - Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers - Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys - Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis) Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: - Diabetes - High blood pressure - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Smoking - Obesity - Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American - Family history of kidney disease - Abnormal kidney structure - Older age Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include: - Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) - A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures - Anemia - Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility - Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures - Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection - Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium) - Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus - Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival As a first step toward diagnosis of kidney disease, your doctor discusses your personal and family history with you. Among other things, your doctor might ask questions about whether you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, if you've taken a medication that might affect kidney function, if you've noticed changes in your urinary habits, and whether you have any family members who have kidney disease. Next, your doctor performs a physical exam, also checking for signs of problems with your heart or blood vessels, and conducts a neurological exam. For kidney disease diagnosis, you may also need certain tests and procedures, such as: - Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood. - Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases. - Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle that's inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what's causing your kidney problem. Depending on the underlying cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure. Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you may need treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Treating the cause Your doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary, depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, has been controlled.

              "text": "Binge eating disorder: Binge eating disorder is the most common type of eating disorder in the United States. People with binge eating disorder often feel out of control and eat a large amount of food at one time (called a binge). Unlike other eating disorders, people who have binge eating disorder do not throw up the food or exercise too much. Binge eating disorder is a serious health problem, but people with binge eating disorder can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder is a type of eating disorder. Eating disorders are mental health problems that cause extreme and dangerous eating behaviors. These extreme eating behaviors cause other serious health problems and sometimes death. Some eating disorders also involve extreme exercise. According to the American Psychiatric Association, women with binge eating disorder feel out of control and eat too much (binge), at least once a week for at least three months. During binges women with binge eating disorder usually eat faster than normal, eat until they are uncomfortable, eat when they are not physically hungry, and feel embarrassed, disgusted, or depressed because of the binges. Women with this type of eating disorder may be overweight or obese. Women with eating disorders, such as binge eating disorder, bulimia, and anorexia, have a mental health condition that affects how they eat, and sometimes how they exercise. These eating disorders threaten their health. Unlike people with anorexia or bulimia, people with binge eating disorder do not throw up their food, exercise a lot, or starve themselves. People with binge eating disorder are often overweight or obese. But not all people with binge eating disorder are overweight, and being overweight does not always mean you have binge eating disorder. It is possible to have more than one eating disorder in your lifetime. Regardless of what type of eating disorder you may have, you can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder affects more than 3% of women in the United States. More than half of people with binge eating disorder are women.1 Binge eating disorder affects women of all races and ethnicities. It is the most common eating disorder among Hispanic, Asian-American, and African-American women.2,3,4 Some women may be more at risk for binge eating disorder. It can be difficult to tell whether someone has binge eating disorder. Many women with binge eating disorder hide their behavior because they are embarrassed. You may have binge eating disorder if, for at least once a week over the past three months, you have binged. Binge eating disorder means you have at least three of these symptoms while binging:8 People with binge eating disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. Researchers are not sure exactly what causes binge eating disorder and other eating disorders. Researchers think that eating disorders might happen because of a combination of a person's biology and life events. This combination includes having specific genes, a person's biology, body image and self-esteem, social experiences, family health history, and sometimes other mental health illnesses. Studies suggest that people with binge eating disorder may use overeating as a way to deal with anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety, or stress.9,10 Researchers are studying how changing levels of brain chemicals may affect eating habits. Neuroimaging, or pictures of the brain, may lead to a better understanding of binge eating disorder.11 Learn more about current research on binge eating disorder. Many, but not all, women with binge eating disorder are overweight or obese. Obesity raises your risk for many serious health problems:12 People with binge eating disorder often have other serious mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. These problems can seriously affect a woman's everyday life and can be treated. Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. It may be difficult to talk to a doctor or nurse about secret eating behaviors. But doctors and nurses want to help you be healthy. Being honest about your eating behaviors with a doctor or nurse is a good way to ask for help. Your doctor may also do blood, urine, or other tests for other health problems, such as heart problems or gallbladder disease, that can be caused by binge eating disorder. Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better. Treatment plans may include one or more of the following: Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat in healthy ways again.14 Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again. Binge eating disorder can cause problems getting pregnant and during pregnancy. Pregnancy can also trigger binge eating disorder. Obesity raises the level of the hormone estrogen in your body. Higher levels of estrogen can stop you from ovulating, or releasing an egg from the ovary. This can make it more difficult to get pregnant. However, if you do not want to have children right now and have sex, you should use birth control. Overweight or obesity may also cause problems during pregnancy. Overweight and obesity raises your risk for: Pregnancy can raise the risk for binge eating disorder in women who are at higher risk for eating disorders. In one study, almost half of the women with binge eating disorder got the condition during pregnancy. The research suggests that binge eating during pregnancy may be caused by:16 After pregnancy, postpartum depression and weight from pregnancy can trigger binge eating disorder in women with a history of binge eating. Women with binge eating disorder before pregnancy often gain more weight during pregnancy than women without an eating disorder. Researchers think that weight gain during pregnancy may cause some women who had binge eating disorder before pregnancy to binge eat during pregnancy.17 Yes. Women who have recovered from binge eating disorder, are at a healthy weight, and have normal menstrual cycles have a better chance of getting pregnant and having a safe and healthy pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you had an eating disorder in the past and are trying to become pregnant. Maybe. Some medicines used to treat binge eating disorder can pass through breastmilk. Certain antidepressants can be used safely during breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor to find out what medicine works best for you. Learn more about medicines and breastfeeding in our Breastfeeding. You can also enter a medicine into the LactMed database to find out if the medicine passes through breastmilk and about any possible side effects for your nursing baby.

It is the most common eating disorder in the United States, affecting millions of people.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n\n1. **Frequent Bingeing Episodes**: A person with binge eating disorder will regularly engage in bingeing episodes, which are defined as eating a large amount of food in a short period (usually within 2 hours) and feeling a lack of control during the episode.\n2. **Lack of Control**: Individuals with binge eating disorder often feel like they cannot stop eating or control the amount of food they consume during a bingeing episode.\n3. **Eating Rapidly**: During a binge, people may eat quickly, even when they are not hungry.\n4. **Eating Until Uncomfortably Full**: Binge eaters often continue eating until they feel uncomfortably full, which can lead to digestive discomfort, nausea, and other physical symptoms.\n5. **Eating Alone**: Due to feelings of shame or guilt, individuals with binge eating disorder may eat alone or in secret.\n6. **Feeling Guilty or Ashamed**: After a binge, people often experience feelings of guilt, shame, or self-criticism, which can worsen the disorder.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors:**\n\nWhile the exact causes of binge eating disorder are unclear, research suggests that a combination of genetic, biological, psychological, and environmental factors contribute to its development. Some risk factors include:\n\n* Family history of eating disorders\n* Trauma or stressful life events\n* Low self-esteem or body dissatisfaction\n* Dieting or restrictive eating patterns\n* Certain mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety\n\n**Symptoms and Complications:**\n\nBinge eating disorder can lead to various physical and emotional symptoms, including:\n\n* Weight gain or obesity\n* Digestive problems (e.g., bloating, constipation)\n* Nutritional deficiencies\n* Sleep disturbances\n* Depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions\n* Social isolation or withdrawal\n\n**Treatment and Recovery:**\n\nBinge eating disorder is treatable, and a comprehensive approach typically involves:\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), or other forms of talk therapy can help individuals address underlying emotional issues and develop healthier eating habits.\n2. **Nutrition Counseling**: A registered dietitian can help individuals develop a balanced eating plan and improve their relationship with food.\n3. **Medications**: In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or anti-seizure medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms.\n4. **Support Groups**: Joining a support group can provide a sense of community and help individuals stay motivated throughout the recovery process.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with binge eating disorder, it's essential to seek professional help from a qualified healthcare provider or a mental health specialist. With proper treatment and support, it is possible to overcome binge eating disorder and develop a healthier, more positive relationship with food and yourself.",

It is the most common eating disorder in the United States, affecting millions of people.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n\n1. **Frequent Bingeing Episodes**: A person with binge eating disorder will regularly engage in bingeing episodes, which are defined as eating a large amount of food in a short period (usually within 2 hours) and feeling a lack of control during the episode.\n2. **Lack of Control**: Individuals with binge eating disorder often feel like they cannot stop eating or control the amount of food they consume during a bingeing episode.\n3. **Eating Rapidly**: During a binge, people may eat quickly, even when they are not hungry.\n4. **Eating Until Uncomfortably Full**: Binge eaters often continue eating until they feel uncomfortably full, which can lead to digestive discomfort, nausea, and other physical symptoms.\n5. **Eating Alone**: Due to feelings of shame or guilt, individuals with binge eating disorder may eat alone or in secret.\n6. **Feeling Guilty or Ashamed**: After a binge, people often experience feelings of guilt, shame, or self-criticism, which can worsen the disorder.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors:**\n\nWhile the exact causes of binge eating disorder are unclear, research suggests that a combination of genetic, biological, psychological, and environmental factors contribute to its development. Some risk factors include:\n\n* Family history of eating disorders\n* Trauma or stressful life events\n* Low self-esteem or body dissatisfaction\n* Dieting or restrictive eating patterns\n* Certain mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety\n\n**Symptoms and Complications:**\n\nBinge eating disorder can lead to various physical and emotional symptoms, including:\n\n* Weight gain or obesity\n* Digestive problems (e.g., bloating, constipation)\n* Nutritional deficiencies\n* Sleep disturbances\n* Depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions\n* Social isolation or withdrawal\n\n**Treatment and Recovery:**\n\nBinge eating disorder is treatable, and a comprehensive approach typically involves:\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), or other forms of talk therapy can help individuals address underlying emotional issues and develop healthier eating habits.\n2. **Nutrition Counseling**: A registered dietitian can help individuals develop a balanced eating plan and improve their relationship with food.\n3. **Medications**: In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or anti-seizure medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms.\n4. **Support Groups**: Joining a support group can provide a sense of community and help individuals stay motivated throughout the recovery process.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with binge eating disorder, it's essential to seek professional help from a qualified healthcare provider or a mental health specialist. With proper treatment and support, it is possible to overcome binge eating disorder and develop a healthier, more positive relationship with food and yourself.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nBinge eating disorder: Binge eating disorder is the most common type of eating disorder in the United States. People with binge eating disorder often feel out of control and eat a large amount of food at one time (called a binge). Unlike other eating disorders, people who have binge eating disorder do not throw up the food or exercise too much. Binge eating disorder is a serious health problem, but people with binge eating disorder can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder is a type of eating disorder. Eating disorders are mental health problems that cause extreme and dangerous eating behaviors. These extreme eating behaviors cause other serious health problems and sometimes death. Some eating disorders also involve extreme exercise. According to the American Psychiatric Association, women with binge eating disorder feel out of control and eat too much (binge), at least once a week for at least three months. During binges women with binge eating disorder usually eat faster than normal, eat until they are uncomfortable, eat when they are not physically hungry, and feel embarrassed, disgusted, or depressed because of the binges. Women with this type of eating disorder may be overweight or obese. Women with eating disorders, such as binge eating disorder, bulimia, and anorexia, have a mental health condition that affects how they eat, and sometimes how they exercise. These eating disorders threaten their health. Unlike people with anorexia or bulimia, people with binge eating disorder do not throw up their food, exercise a lot, or starve themselves. People with binge eating disorder are often overweight or obese. But not all people with binge eating disorder are overweight, and being overweight does not always mean you have binge eating disorder. It is possible to have more than one eating disorder in your lifetime. Regardless of what type of eating disorder you may have, you can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder affects more than 3% of women in the United States. More than half of people with binge eating disorder are women.1 Binge eating disorder affects women of all races and ethnicities. It is the most common eating disorder among Hispanic, Asian-American, and African-American women.2,3,4 Some women may be more at risk for binge eating disorder. It can be difficult to tell whether someone has binge eating disorder. Many women with binge eating disorder hide their behavior because they are embarrassed. You may have binge eating disorder if, for at least once a week over the past three months, you have binged. Binge eating disorder means you have at least three of these symptoms while binging:8 People with binge eating disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. Researchers are not sure exactly what causes binge eating disorder and other eating disorders. Researchers think that eating disorders might happen because of a combination of a person's biology and life events. This combination includes having specific genes, a person's biology, body image and self-esteem, social experiences, family health history, and sometimes other mental health illnesses. Studies suggest that people with binge eating disorder may use overeating as a way to deal with anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety, or stress.9,10 Researchers are studying how changing levels of brain chemicals may affect eating habits. Neuroimaging, or pictures of the brain, may lead to a better understanding of binge eating disorder.11 Learn more about current research on binge eating disorder. Many, but not all, women with binge eating disorder are overweight or obese. Obesity raises your risk for many serious health problems:12 People with binge eating disorder often have other serious mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. These problems can seriously affect a woman's everyday life and can be treated. Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. It may be difficult to talk to a doctor or nurse about secret eating behaviors. But doctors and nurses want to help you be healthy. Being honest about your eating behaviors with a doctor or nurse is a good way to ask for help. Your doctor may also do blood, urine, or other tests for other health problems, such as heart problems or gallbladder disease, that can be caused by binge eating disorder. Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better. Treatment plans may include one or more of the following: Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat in healthy ways again.14 Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again. Binge eating disorder can cause problems getting pregnant and during pregnancy. Pregnancy can also trigger binge eating disorder. Obesity raises the level of the hormone estrogen in your body. Higher levels of estrogen can stop you from ovulating, or releasing an egg from the ovary. This can make it more difficult to get pregnant. However, if you do not want to have children right now and have sex, you should use birth control. Overweight or obesity may also cause problems during pregnancy. Overweight and obesity raises your risk for: Pregnancy can raise the risk for binge eating disorder in women who are at higher risk for eating disorders. In one study, almost half of the women with binge eating disorder got the condition during pregnancy. The research suggests that binge eating during pregnancy may be caused by:16 After pregnancy, postpartum depression and weight from pregnancy can trigger binge eating disorder in women with a history of binge eating. Women with binge eating disorder before pregnancy often gain more weight during pregnancy than women without an eating disorder. Researchers think that weight gain during pregnancy may cause some women who had binge eating disorder before pregnancy to binge eat during pregnancy.17 Yes. Women who have recovered from binge eating disorder, are at a healthy weight, and have normal menstrual cycles have a better chance of getting pregnant and having a safe and healthy pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you had an eating disorder in the past and are trying to become pregnant. Maybe. Some medicines used to treat binge eating disorder can pass through breastmilk. Certain antidepressants can be used safely during breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor to find out what medicine works best for you. Learn more about medicines and breastfeeding in our Breastfeeding. You can also enter a medicine into the LactMed database to find out if the medicine passes through breastmilk and about any possible side effects for your nursing baby.

              "text": "COPD: Espa\u00f1ol \u00a0 Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause\u00a0coughing\u00a0that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants\u2014such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts\u2014also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand\u00a0how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions\u2014emphysema\u00a0and chronic\u00a0bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease."

In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions\u2014emphysema\u00a0and chronic\u00a0bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity\u2014from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development\u2014can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy."

Smoking during pregnancy also has been linked to several congenital heart defects, including septal defects. Researchers continue to search for the causes of congenital heart defects."

Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), unusual prominence of the breastbone (pigeon chest, or pectus carinatum), dental abnormalities, and short, hyperextensible, tapered fingers. Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males. The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1). Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two.

            "text": "Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone growth and development. It is the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism, accounting for approximately 70% of all cases of dwarfism. The disorder is characterized by a range of physical and medical characteristics that can affect various aspects of an individual's life.\n\n**Causes and Inheritance:**\nAchondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. This protein plays a crucial role in bone growth and development. The mutation leads to abnormal bone growth, resulting in the characteristic features of the disorder. Achondroplasia can be inherited from one's parents in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. However, most cases result from new mutations that occur during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development, which means the parents of an individual with achondroplasia are typically of average height.\n\n**Physical Characteristics:**\nIndividuals with achondroplasia have a range of physical features, including:\n- Short stature: This is the most noticeable characteristic, with adults typically reaching a height of about 4 feet (1.2 meters) for males and slightly less for females.\n- Short arms and legs: The limbs are disproportionately shorter compared to the torso.\n- Large head size: Infants and children with achondroplasia often have a larger head compared to their body size.\n- Prominent forehead: The forehead may appear prominent or protruding.\n- Underdeveloped midface: The middle part of the face may appear underdeveloped, which can lead to breathing difficulties.\n- Short upper arm bones (humeri) and short thigh bones (femora): These are characteristic of the disorder.\n- Limited elbow extension: People with achondroplasia often have difficulty fully straightening their elbows.\n- Bowing of the legs: The legs may be bowed, which can affect walking and balance.\n\n**Health Implications:**\nWhile achondroplasia is primarily known for its effects on physical appearance and growth, it is also associated with several potential health complications. These include:\n- Respiratory problems: Due to the underdeveloped midface, individuals may experience breathing difficulties, especially during sleep.\n- Sleep apnea: The abnormal bone structure in the face and skull can lead to obstruction of the airways during sleep.\n- Hydrocephalus: Accumulation of fluid in the brain, which can increase pressure within the skull.\n- Spinal issues: Narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.\n- Hearing loss: Both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses have been associated with achondroplasia.\n- Obese tendency: Individuals may have a tendency towards obesity, which can exacerbate many of the associated health issues.\n\n**Management and Treatment:**\nWhile there is no cure for achondroplasia, various treatments and interventions can help manage the condition and its complications. These include:\n- Hormonal treatments: Human growth hormone (HGH) therapy may be used to increase height, but its effectiveness and potential long-term effects are still being researched.\n- Surgical interventions: Various surgeries can address specific issues such as limb lengthening, spinal problems, and respiratory complications.\n- Physical therapy: To improve mobility and reduce the risk of complications.\n- Supportive care: Regular monitoring by healthcare professionals to address any emerging health issues promptly.\n\nIt's essential for individuals with achondroplasia and their families to work closely with healthcare providers to manage the disorder and its associated health challenges. Early intervention and a comprehensive care plan can significantly improve quality of life.",

          "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nwhat is the disorder achondroplasia\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nAchondroplasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone growth and development. It is the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism, accounting for approximately 70% of all cases of dwarfism. The disorder is characterized by a range of physical and medical characteristics that can affect various aspects of an individual's life.\n\n**Causes and Inheritance:**\nAchondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. This protein plays a crucial role in bone growth and development. The mutation leads to abnormal bone growth, resulting in the characteristic features of the disorder. Achondroplasia can be inherited from one's parents in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. However, most cases result from new mutations that occur during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development, which means the parents of an individual with achondroplasia are typically of average height.\n\n**Physical Characteristics:**\nIndividuals with achondroplasia have a range of physical features, including:\n- Short stature: This is the most noticeable characteristic, with adults typically reaching a height of about 4 feet (1.2 meters) for males and slightly less for females.\n- Short arms and legs: The limbs are disproportionately shorter compared to the torso.\n- Large head size: Infants and children with achondroplasia often have a larger head compared to their body size.\n- Prominent forehead: The forehead may appear prominent or protruding.\n- Underdeveloped midface: The middle part of the face may appear underdeveloped, which can lead to breathing difficulties.\n- Short upper arm bones (humeri) and short thigh bones (femora): These are characteristic of the disorder.\n- Limited elbow extension: People with achondroplasia often have difficulty fully straightening their elbows.\n- Bowing of the legs: The legs may be bowed, which can affect walking and balance.\n\n**Health Implications:**\nWhile achondroplasia is primarily known for its effects on physical appearance and growth, it is also associated with several potential health complications. These include:\n- Respiratory problems: Due to the underdeveloped midface, individuals may experience breathing difficulties, especially during sleep.\n- Sleep apnea: The abnormal bone structure in the face and skull can lead to obstruction of the airways during sleep.\n- Hydrocephalus: Accumulation of fluid in the brain, which can increase pressure within the skull.\n- Spinal issues: Narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.\n- Hearing loss: Both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses have been associated with achondroplasia.\n- Obese tendency: Individuals may have a tendency towards obesity, which can exacerbate many of the associated health issues.\n\n**Management and Treatment:**\nWhile there is no cure for achondroplasia, various treatments and interventions can help manage the condition and its complications. These include:\n- Hormonal treatments: Human growth hormone (HGH) therapy may be used to increase height, but its effectiveness and potential long-term effects are still being researched.\n- Surgical interventions: Various surgeries can address specific issues such as limb lengthening, spinal problems, and respiratory complications.\n- Physical therapy: To improve mobility and reduce the risk of complications.\n- Supportive care: Regular monitoring by healthcare professionals to address any emerging health issues promptly.\n\nIt's essential for individuals with achondroplasia and their families to work closely with healthcare providers to manage the disorder and its associated health challenges. Early intervention and a comprehensive care plan can significantly improve quality of life.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat is Achondroplasia?: Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that prevents the changing of cartilage (particularly in the long bones of the arms and legs) to bone. It is characterized by dwarfism, limited range of motion at the elbows, large head size, small fingers, and normal intelligence. Achondroplasia can cause health complications such as apnea, obesity, recurrent ear infections, and lordosis of the spine. Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Treatment options may include:\n\n1. **Watchful Waiting**: For some patients with slow-growing (indolent) lymphomas that are not causing symptoms, the doctor may recommend a period of watchful waiting (active surveillance) before starting treatment. During this time, the patient's condition is closely monitored with regular check-ups and tests to see if the lymphoma is growing or causing problems.\n\n2. **Chemotherapy**: This is a common treatment for lymphoma, using drugs to kill lymphoma cells. Chemotherapy may be given orally or intravenously (through a vein). It can be used alone or in combination with other treatments.\n\n3. **Radiation Therapy**: This involves using high-energy rays to kill lymphoma cells. It can be used alone or, more often, in combination with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is more commonly used in early-stage lymphomas.\n\n4. **Immunotherapy**: Also known as biologic therapy, this treatment uses substances that stimulate the immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells. Examples include rituximab (Rituxan), which targets a protein on the surface of B cells (a type of lymphocyte), and checkpoint inhibitors.\n\n5. **Targeted Therapy**: These are drugs that specifically target cancer cells or the factors that help them grow. For lymphoma, targeted therapies can include drugs that inhibit specific proteins or pathways that cancer cells need to grow and survive.\n\n6. **Stem Cell Transplant**: This procedure involves high doses of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both to kill the lymphoma cells, followed by an infusion of stem cells (either the patient's own, known as autologous transplant, or from a donor, known as allogeneic transplant) to help the bone marrow recover and produce healthy cells.\n\n7. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be performed to remove a lymphoma in one specific area, such as the spleen or a lymph node. However, surgery alone is rarely used to treat lymphoma.\n\n8. **Clinical Trials**: Patients may also participate in clinical trials to receive new or experimental treatments that are under investigation.\n\nThe treatment plan for lymphoma can be complex and requires careful consideration by a healthcare team that may include a medical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, and a hematologist. It's essential for patients to discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider to understand the goals of treatment (whether it's to cure the disease, control its growth, or relieve symptoms), potential side effects, and what to expect during treatment.",

              "text": "Bronchitis: Espa\u00f1ol Bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) is a condition in which the bronchial tubes become inflamed. These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.) People who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath. Bronchitis Overview The two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing). Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed). Sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone. Several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis. Most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care. Chronic Bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. Viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual. Chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis. Acute bronchitis Chronic bronchitis Industrial bronchitis Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Sometimes bacteria can cause the condition. Certain substances can irritate your lungs and airways and raise your risk for acute bronchitis. For example, inhaling or being exposed to tobacco smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution raises your risk for the condition. These lung irritants also can make symptoms worse. Being exposed to a high level of dust or fumes, such as from an explosion or a big fire, also may lead to acute bronchitis. Chronic Bronchitis Repeatedly breathing in fumes that irritate and damage lung and airway tissues causes chronic bronchitis. Smoking is the major cause of the condition. Breathing in air pollution and dust or fumes from the environment or workplace also can lead to chronic bronchitis. People who have chronic bronchitis go through periods when symptoms become much worse than usual. During these times, they also may have acute viral or bacterial bronchitis. Bronchitis is a very common condition. Millions of cases occur every year. Elderly people, infants, and young children are at higher risk for acute bronchitis than people in other age groups. People of all ages can develop chronic bronchitis, but it occurs more often in people who are older than 45. Also, many adults who develop chronic bronchitis are smokers. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. Smoking and having an existing lung disease greatly increase your risk for bronchitis. Contact with dust, chemical fumes, and vapors from certain jobs also increases your risk for the condition. Examples include jobs in coal mining, textile manufacturing, grain handling, and livestock farming. Air pollution, infections, and allergies can worsen the symptoms of chronic bronchitis, especially if you smoke. Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis caused by an infection usually develops after you already have a cold or the flu. Symptoms of a cold or the flu include sore throat, fatigue (tiredness), fever, body aches, stuffy or runny nose, vomiting, and diarrhea. The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a persistent cough, which may last 10 to 20 days. The cough may produce clear mucus (a slimy substance). If the mucus is yellow or green, you may have a bacterial infection as well. Even after the infection clears up, you may still have a dry cough for days or weeks. Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), low fever, and chest tightness or pain. If your acute bronchitis is severe, you also may have shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Chronic Bronchitis The signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis include coughing, wheezing, and chest discomfort. The coughing may produce large amounts of mucus. This type of cough often is called a smoker's cough. Your doctor usually will diagnose bronchitis based on your signs and symptoms. He or she may ask questions about your cough, such as how long you've had it, what you're coughing up, and how much you cough. Your doctor also will likely ask: About your medical history Whether you've recently had a cold or the flu Whether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke Whether you've been exposed to dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds in your lungs. He or she also may: Look at your mucus to see whether you have a bacterial infection Test the oxygen levels in your blood using a sensor attached to your fingertip or toe Recommend a chest x ray, lung function tests, or blood tests The main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier. If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. Antibiotics usually aren't prescribed for acute bronchitis. This is because they don't work against viruses\u2014the most common cause of acute bronchitis. However, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. A humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. If your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. You take this medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists). If you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. These medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form). If you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. This treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen. One of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. If you smoke, it's very important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants, such as dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. You can't always prevent acute or chronic bronchitis. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for both conditions. The most important step is to quit smoking or not start smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For example, wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you use paint, paint remover, varnish, or other substances with strong fumes. This will help protect your lungs. Wash your hands often to limit your exposure to germs and bacteria. Your doctor also may advise you to get a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition. Lifestyle Changes The most important step is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. This will help keep your lungs healthy. Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling."

For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For example, wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you use paint, paint remover, varnish, or other substances with strong fumes. This will help protect your lungs. Wash your hands often to limit your exposure to germs and bacteria. Your doctor also may advise you to get a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition. Lifestyle Changes The most important step is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. This will help keep your lungs healthy. Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

While there is no specific \"cure\" for chickenpox, treatment focuses on relieving symptoms, reducing the risk of complications, and helping the body fight off the infection. Here are some common treatments used to manage chickenpox:\n\n**Antiviral Medications:**\n\n1. **Acyclovir**: This antiviral medication can help reduce the severity and duration of chickenpox symptoms, especially if started within the first 24 hours of rash onset.\n2. **Valacyclovir**: Similar to acyclovir, valacyclovir can help alleviate symptoms and is often prescribed for adults and children over 2 years old.\n\n**Symptom Relief:**\n\n1. **Fever reduction**: Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help reduce fever and relieve headaches.\n2. **Itch relief**: Calamine lotion, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), or topical creams (like hydrocortisone) can help soothe itchy skin.\n3. **Skin care**: Keeping the skin clean and dry can help prevent infection and promote healing.\n\n**Supportive Care:**\n\n1. **Rest**: Getting plenty of rest can help the body recover from the infection.\n2. **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, clear soups, or electrolyte-rich beverages, can help replace lost fluids and electrolytes.\n3. **Nutrition**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help support the immune system.\n\n**Prevention:**\n\n1. **Vaccination**: The varicella vaccine is highly effective in preventing chickenpox. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended for children, with the first dose given at 12-15 months and the second dose at 4-6 years.\n2. **Avoid close contact**: Avoiding close contact with people who have chickenpox can help prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention:**\n\nWhile most cases of chickenpox can be managed at home, it's essential to seek medical attention if you or your child experience:\n\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Severe headache or stiff neck\n* Confusion or disorientation\n* Severe vomiting or diarrhea\n* Fever above 103\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C)\n* Widespread rash or blisters\n* Signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus around the blisters\n\nRemember, if you're unsure about the severity of symptoms or the best course of treatment, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.",

It is common in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States. Symptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening. There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then, drinking lots of fluids, resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids. To lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is found - Wear insect repellent with DEET - Wear clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet - Close unscreened doors and windows NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"

However, certain groups of people are at a higher risk of contracting the disease or experiencing severe symptoms.\n\n**Age:** While dengue fever can occur at any age, it is more common in children under the age of 15, especially in areas where the disease is endemic. This is because younger children are more susceptible to the virus and may not have developed immunity to it. In contrast, older adults may be more likely to experience severe symptoms, such as hemorrhaging or shock, due to age-related health issues.\n\n**Geographic location:** People living in or traveling to tropical and subtropical areas of the world, particularly in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, are at higher risk of contracting dengue fever. These regions have the highest incidence of the disease, and the virus is often transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, which is commonly found in these areas.\n\n** Race:** There is no specific racial or ethnic group that is more prone to contracting dengue fever. However, people of Asian and African descent may be more likely to experience severe symptoms due to genetic factors that affect their immune response to the virus.\n\n**Other risk factors:** Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, may increase the risk of severe symptoms or complications from dengue fever. Additionally, people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy, may be more susceptible to the disease.\n\n**Pregnancy:** Pregnant women are not at higher risk of contracting dengue fever, but they may be more likely to experience severe symptoms, such as preterm labor or fetal distress, if they become infected.\n\n**Travelers:** Travelers to areas where dengue fever is endemic are at risk of contracting the disease, especially if they do not take proper precautions, such as using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding areas with high mosquito activity.\n\nIn summary, while anyone can contract dengue fever, certain groups, such as children under 15, older adults, and people living in or traveling to tropical and subtropical areas, are at higher risk of infection or severe symptoms. It is essential to take preventive measures, such as using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing, to reduce the risk of contracting dengue fever, especially for people in high-risk groups.",

It is essential to take preventive measures, such as using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing, to reduce the risk of contracting dengue fever, especially for people in high-risk groups.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nDengue (Summary): Summary Dengue is an infection caused by a virus. You can get it if an infected mosquito bites you. Dengue does not spread from person to person. It is common in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States. Symptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening. There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then, drinking lots of fluids, resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids. To lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is found - Wear insect repellent with DEET - Wear clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet - Close unscreened doors and windows NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

            "text": "You should not take grapefruit or grapefruit juice with felodipine because grapefruit can significantly increase the levels of felodipine in your bloodstream, leading to potentially severe side effects. \n\nFelodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure. It works by relaxing blood vessels so blood can flow more easily, thereby lowering blood pressure. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice contain compounds known as furanocoumarins, which can inhibit the activity of an enzyme in the intestine called CYP3A4. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down felodipine into less active compounds before it enters the bloodstream. When grapefruit or its juice is consumed, the inhibition of CYP3A4 leads to less felodipine being broken down, resulting in higher concentrations of the drug in the body.\n\nThe increased levels of felodipine can enhance its blood pressure-lowering effects, which may lead to hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure). Symptoms of hypotension can include dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, and an increased risk of heart problems. Other possible side effects of elevated felodipine levels include peripheral edema (swelling of the legs and ankles), headache, and palpitations.\n\nTo avoid these interactions, it's recommended that patients taking felodipine avoid consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice altogether. If you're taking felodipine, you should speak with your healthcare provider or pharmacist about any other foods or drugs that might interact with your medication, and always follow their advice on how to safely manage your treatment regimen.",

              "text": "Staph infections: Staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria, types of germs commonly found on the skin or in the nose of even healthy individuals. Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or result in relatively minor skin infections. But staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and drainage of the infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond to common antibiotics. Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). As a result, signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include: - Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil, a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks. - Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually features large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust. - Cellulitis. Cellulitis - an infection of the deeper layers of skin - causes skin redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores (ulcers) or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too. - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced as a result of a staph infection may lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition features fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off - leaving a red, raw surface that looks like a burn. Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include: - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Dehydration - Low blood pressure Also known as blood poisoning, septicemia occurs when staph bacteria enter a person's bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of septicemia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body, to produce infections affecting: - Internal organs, such as your brain, heart or lungs - Bones and muscles - Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria and has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with: - A high fever - Nausea and vomiting - A rash on your palms and soles that resembles sunburn - Confusion - Muscle aches - Diarrhea - Abdominal pain Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Signs and symptoms may include: - Joint swelling - Severe pain in the affected joint - Fever Go to the doctor if you or your child has: - An area of red, irritated or painful skin - Pus-filled blisters - Fever You may also want to consult your doctor if: - Skin infections are being passed from one family member to another - Two or more family members have skin infections at the same time Many people carry staph bacteria and never develop staph infections. However, if you develop a staph infection, there's a good chance that it's from bacteria you've been carrying around for some time. These bacteria can also be transmitted from person to person. Because staph bacteria are so hardy, they can live on inanimate objects such as pillowcases or towels long enough to transfer to the next person who touches them. Staph bacteria are able to survive: - Drying - Extremes of temperature - Stomach acid - High levels of salt A variety of factors - including the status of your immune system to the types of sports you play - can increase your risk of developing staph infections. Certain disorders or the medications used to treat them can make you more susceptible to staph infections. People who may be more likely to get a staph infection include those with: - Diabetes who use insulin - HIV/AIDS - Kidney failure requiring dialysis - Weakened immune systems - either from a disease or medications that suppress the immune system - Cancer, especially those who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation - Skin damage from conditions such as eczema, insect bites or minor trauma that opens the skin - Respiratory illness, such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema Despite vigorous attempts to eradicate them, staph bacteria remain present in hospitals, where they attack the most vulnerable, including people with: - Weakened immune systems - Burns - Surgical wounds Staph bacteria can travel along the medical tubing that connects the outside world with your internal organs. Examples include: - Dialysis tubing - Urinary catheters - Feeding tubes - Breathing tubes - Intravascular catheters Staph bacteria can spread easily through cuts, abrasions and skin-to-skin contact. Staph infections may also spread in the locker room through shared razors, towels, uniforms or equipment. Food handlers who don't properly wash their hands can transfer staph from their skin to the food they're preparing. Foods that are contaminated with staph look and taste normal. If staph bacteria invade your bloodstream, you may develop a type of infection that affects your entire body. Called sepsis, this infection can lead to septic shock - a life-threatening episode with extremely low blood pressure. To diagnose a staph infection, your doctor will: - Perform a physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will closely examine any skin lesions you may have. - Collect a sample for testing. Most often, doctors diagnose staph infections by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of the bacteria. Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you're given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin."

Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani, which can enter the body through wounds or cuts. The bacteria produce toxins that can affect the nervous system, leading to muscle stiffness, spasms, and rigidity.\n\nIf tetanus is severe, it can cause respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and eventually death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tetanus is estimated to cause around 50,000 to 100,000 deaths per year worldwide, mostly in low-income countries where access to vaccination and medical care is limited.\n\nThe most common causes of death from tetanus include:\n\n1. Respiratory failure: Tetanus toxins can cause the muscles used for breathing to become rigid, leading to respiratory failure.\n2. Cardiac arrest: The toxins can also affect the heart, leading to cardiac arrest.\n3. Secondary infections: Tetanus can lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia, which can be fatal if not treated promptly.\n4. Sepsis: In rare cases, tetanus can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection becomes uncontrolled and causes widespread inflammation.\n\nIt's essential to seek medical attention immediately if you suspect you have tetanus. Prompt treatment, including wound cleaning, antibiotics, and tetanus immunoglobulin, can help prevent complications and reduce the risk of death. Vaccination against tetanus is also crucial in preventing the disease, and it's recommended that adults receive a booster shot every 10 years to maintain immunity.",

Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months. Complications of tetanus infection may include: - Broken bones. The severity of spasms may cause the spine and other bones to break. - Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism). A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches. - Death. Severe tetanus-induced (tetanic) muscle spasms can interfere with or stop your breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Lack of oxygen may also induce cardiac arrest and death. Pneumonia is another cause of death.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",
