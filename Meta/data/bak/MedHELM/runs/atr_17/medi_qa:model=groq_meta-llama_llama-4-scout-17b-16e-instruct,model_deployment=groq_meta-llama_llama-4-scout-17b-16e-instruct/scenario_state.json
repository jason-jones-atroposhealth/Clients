              "text": "Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome: Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is a rare disease passed down through families. The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through the intestines. Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by a defect in a gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). The defect makes it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins. It is an autosomal recessive condition that more often affects males. Symptoms include: - Balance and coordination difficulties - Curvature of spine - Decreased vision that gets worse over time - Developmental delay - Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy - Muscle weakness - Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10 - Protruding abdomen - Slurred speech - Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools There may be damage to the retina of the eye (retinitis pigmentosa). Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include: - Apolipoprotein B blood test - Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K) - \"Burr-cell\" malformation of the red cells (acanthocytosis) - Complete blood count (CBC) - Cholesterol studies - Electromyography - Eye exam - Nerve conduction velocity - Stool sample analysis Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the MTP gene. Treatment involves large doses of vitamin supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. People with this condition should talk to a nutritionist. Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This involves: - Limiting fat intake to 5 to 20 grams per day. - Do not eat more than 5 ounces daily (140 grams) of lean meat, fish, or poultry. - Use skim milk instead of whole milk. Supplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider. They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage. How well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. Complications may include: - Blindness - Mental deterioration - Loss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia) Call your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person. High doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.

Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling."

Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production, leading to anemia and other complications.\n\nFirstly, I want to clarify that it's highly unlikely that your friend's blood cells are completely absent, as that would be incompatible with life.

Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 6 to 12. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may occur with other types of seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: - Occur many times a day - Occur for weeks to months before being noticed - Interfere with school and learning - Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: - Stop walking and start again a few seconds later - Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: - Wide awake - Thinking clearly - Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: - Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing - Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.

              "text": "Adrenoleukodystrophy: Adrenoleukodystrophy describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. These disorders are passed down (inherited) in families. Adrenoleukodystrophy is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait. It affects mostly males, although some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races. The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body. There are 3 major categories of disease: - Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8) - Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life - Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones Childhood cerebral type symptoms include: - Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements - Crossed eyes - Handwriting that gets worse - Difficulty at school - Difficulty understanding what people are saying - Hearing loss - Hyperactivity - Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis - Seizures - Swallowing difficulties - Visual impairment or blindness Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include: - Difficulty controlling urination - Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness - Problems with thinking speed and visual memory Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include: - Coma - Decreased appetite - Increased skin color - Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting) - Muscle weakness - Vomiting Tests for this condition include: - Blood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland - Chromosome study to look for changes (mutations) in the ABCD1 gene - MRI of the head Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition. The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs. The other forms of this disease are milder. These complications can occur: - Adrenal crisis - Vegetative state Call your health care provider if: - Your child develops symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy - Your child has X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and is getting worse Genetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition. Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is also available. It is done by testing cells from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These tests look for either a known genetic change in the family or for very long chain fatty acid levels.

Here's an overview:\n\n**What is Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)?**\n\nAdrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the production of a protein called adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). This protein is necessary for the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the body. Without ALDP, VLCFAs accumulate in the brain, adrenal glands, and testes, leading to damage and dysfunction.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\nThe symptoms of ALD vary depending on the age of onset and the severity of the condition. There are several forms of ALD:\n\n1. **Childhood cerebral ALD**: This is the most common form, typically affecting boys between 4-8 years old. Symptoms include:\n\t* Vision and hearing loss\n\t* Seizures\n\t* Muscle weakness and loss of coordination\n\t* Loss of cognitive and motor skills\n\t* Behavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and aggression\n2. **Adolescent and adult forms**: These forms can present with:\n\t* Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)\n\t* Impaired vision and hearing\n\t* Muscle weakness and spasticity\n\t* Loss of coordination and balance\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors:**\n\nALD is caused by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene, which codes for the ALDP protein. The condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning:\n\n* Boys are more likely to be affected, as they have only one X chromosome.\n* Girls can be carriers, but they are less likely to develop the condition, as they have two X chromosomes.\n\n**Treatment and Management:**\n\nThere is no cure for ALD, but various treatments can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression:\n\n1. **Dietary therapy**: A strict diet low in VLCFAs can help reduce the accumulation of toxic fatty acids.\n2. **Medications**: Medications such as corticosteroids and bronchodilators can help manage symptoms.\n3. **Bone marrow transplantation**: This can help replace the defective ALDP protein with a healthy one.\n4. **Gene therapy**: Researchers are exploring gene therapy as a potential treatment.\n\n**Supporting a Child with ALD:**\n\nWhen working with a child with ALD, it's essential to:\n\n1. **Develop a individualized education plan**: Collaborate with teachers, therapists, and parents to create a plan that meets the child's specific needs.\n2. **Provide emotional support**: ALD can cause behavioral and emotional challenges; offer a supportive and understanding environment.\n3. **Encourage physical activity**: Regular exercise can help maintain mobility and coordination.\n4. **Communicate with healthcare professionals**: Regularly update and consult with the child's healthcare team to ensure the best possible care.\n\nI hope this information helps you better understand adrenoleukodystrophy and support the child in your care.

Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence."

It is characterized by intellectual disability, speech impairment, and ataxia, among other symptoms.\n\nRegarding the question of whether a person with Angelman syndrome can have children, the answer is yes, but it's relatively rare and often requires assisted reproductive technology.\n\nThe likelihood of a person with Angelman syndrome having children depends on several factors:\n\n1. **Intellectual disability and communication challenges**: Many individuals with Angelman syndrome have significant intellectual disability and communication challenges, which can make it difficult to form and maintain relationships, including those necessary for reproduction.\n2. **Reproductive capability**: Females with Angelman syndrome are more likely to be fertile than males. However, males with the condition may have reproductive difficulties due to issues like cryptorchidism (undescended testes) or low sperm count.\n\nIf a person with Angelman syndrome does become pregnant, there is a chance that the disorder can be passed on to their offspring. However, the inheritance pattern of Angelman syndrome is complex:\n\n* **Deletion or mutation**: In about 70% of cases, Angelman syndrome is caused by a deletion or mutation of the UBE3A gene on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. If a person with Angelman syndrome has a deletion or mutation, they are unlikely to pass on a functional copy of the gene to their offspring.\n* **Imprinting**: The UBE3A gene is subject to genomic imprinting, which means that only the maternal copy of the gene is expressed in the brain. If a person with Angelman syndrome inherits a mutated or deleted UBE3A gene from their mother, they will express the disorder. However, if they inherit a normal UBE3A gene from their father, they may not express the disorder but can still pass on the mutated gene to their offspring.\n\nThe risks of passing on Angelman syndrome to offspring are:\n\n* **Maternal inheritance**: If a mother has Angelman syndrome due to a deletion or mutation, her children have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene. However, only if they inherit the mutated gene from their mother and do not inherit a normal gene from their father will they express the disorder.\n* **Paternal inheritance**: If a father has Angelman syndrome, his daughters will inherit his mutated gene, but they are unlikely to express the disorder themselves due to the presence of a normal maternal UBE3A gene. However, his daughters will have a 50% chance of passing on the mutated gene to their sons, who may express the disorder.\n\nIt's essential to note that genetic counseling and testing are crucial for individuals with Angelman syndrome who are considering reproduction. A genetic counselor can help assess the risks and provide guidance on family planning options.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible for a person with Angelman syndrome to have children, the likelihood and risks of passing on the disorder are complex and depend on several factors, including the underlying genetic cause of the condition and the individual's reproductive capabilities.",

However, if they inherit a normal UBE3A gene from their father, they may not express the disorder but can still pass on the mutated gene to their offspring.\n\nThe risks of passing on Angelman syndrome to offspring are:\n\n* **Maternal inheritance**: If a mother has Angelman syndrome due to a deletion or mutation, her children have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene. However, only if they inherit the mutated gene from their mother and do not inherit a normal gene from their father will they express the disorder.\n* **Paternal inheritance**: If a father has Angelman syndrome, his daughters will inherit his mutated gene, but they are unlikely to express the disorder themselves due to the presence of a normal maternal UBE3A gene. However, his daughters will have a 50% chance of passing on the mutated gene to their sons, who may express the disorder.\n\nIt's essential to note that genetic counseling and testing are crucial for individuals with Angelman syndrome who are considering reproduction. A genetic counselor can help assess the risks and provide guidance on family planning options.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible for a person with Angelman syndrome to have children, the likelihood and risks of passing on the disorder are complex and depend on several factors, including the underlying genetic cause of the condition and the individual's reproductive capabilities.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nIs Angelman syndrome inherited?: Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a mutation in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Hairy cell leukemia (Treatment): Treatment isn't always necessary for people with hairy cell leukemia. Because this cancer progresses very slowly and sometimes doesn't progress at all, some people prefer to wait to treat their cancer only if it causes signs and symptoms. The majority of people with hairy cell leukemia eventually need treatment. If your hairy cell leukemia causes signs and symptoms, you may decide to undergo treatment. There is no cure for hairy cell leukemia. But treatments are effective at putting hairy cell leukemia in remission for years. Chemotherapy Doctors consider chemotherapy drugs the first line of treatment for hairy cell leukemia. The great majority of people will experience complete or partial remission through the use of chemotherapy. Two chemotherapy drugs are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Cladribine. Treatment for hairy cell leukemia typically begins with cladribine. You receive a continuous infusion of the drug into a vein over several days. Most people who receive cladribine experience a complete remission that can last for several years. If your hairy cell leukemia returns, you can be treated with cladribine again. Side effects of cladribine may include infection and fever. - Pentostatin (Nipent). Pentostatin causes remission rates similar to cladribine, but it's given on a different schedule. People who take pentostatin receive infusions every other week for three to six months. Side effects of pentostatin may include fever, nausea and infection. Biological treatments Biological therapy attempts to make cancer cells more recognizable to your immune system. Once your immune system identifies cancer cells as intruders, it can set about destroying your cancer. Two types of biological treatments are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Interferon. Currently, the role of interferon in hairy cell leukemia treatment is limited. You might receive interferon if chemotherapy hasn't been effective or if you can't take chemotherapy. Most people experience partial remission with interferon, which is taken for a year. Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as fever and fatigue. - Rituximab (Rituxan). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though it's sometimes used in hairy cell leukemia. If chemotherapy drugs haven't worked for you or you can't take chemotherapy, your doctor might consider rituximab. Side effects of rituximab include fever and infection. Surgery Surgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy) might be an option if your spleen ruptures or if it's enlarged and causing pain. Though removing your spleen can't cure hairy cell leukemia, it can usually restore normal blood counts. Splenectomy isn't commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia, but it may be helpful in certain situations. Any surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection."

It's characterized by an abnormal growth of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that appear \"hairy\" under a microscope. The disease is more common in middle-aged men, and your father's age is within the typical range.\n\n**Is Hairy Cell Leukemia dangerous?**\nHairy Cell Leukemia is a serious disease, but it's considered a manageable and treatable cancer. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as:\n\n* Infections\n* Bleeding problems\n* Organ damage (e.g., spleen, liver)\n* Bone marrow failure\n\nHowever, with proper treatment, most people with HCL can experience significant improvement and live for many years.\n\n**Is there treatment for Hairy Cell Leukemia?**\nYes, there are effective treatments for HCL. The primary treatments include:\n\n1. **Chemotherapy**: The most common treatment is a chemotherapy medication called cladribine (Leustatin), which can induce long-term remission.\n2. **Targeted therapy**: Another medication, pentostatin (Nipent), is also used to treat HCL.\n3. **Surgery**: In some cases, splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be necessary to manage symptoms.\n4. **Watchful waiting**: For some patients with minimal symptoms, doctors may recommend monitoring the disease with regular blood tests and bone marrow biopsies.\n\n**Long-term prognosis and life expectancy**\nThe prognosis for Hairy Cell Leukemia is generally good, especially with treatment. Studies have shown that:\n\n* With chemotherapy, the overall response rate is around 80-90%, with a median survival rate of 10-15 years or more.\n* Patients who achieve a complete remission have a better long-term outcome, with some studies suggesting a 15-20 year survival rate.\n\nConsidering your father's age (55) and assuming he receives proper treatment, his life expectancy can be estimated as follows:\n\n* A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that patients with HCL diagnosed between 50-59 years old had a median survival rate of approximately 12-15 years.\n* Another study published in the British Journal of Haematology reported that patients with HCL had a similar life expectancy to the general population, with a 10-year survival rate of around 80%.\n\nKeep in mind that individual outcomes can vary depending on several factors, including overall health, response to treatment, and presence of other medical conditions.\n\n**Next steps**\nIt's essential to discuss your father's specific situation with his doctor, including:\n\n* Treatment options and potential side effects\n* Follow-up appointments and testing schedules\n* Lifestyle modifications to manage symptoms and improve quality of life\n\nEncourage your father to ask his doctor about the best course of treatment and what to expect in the long term. Additionally, consider seeking a second opinion to ensure that you and your father have a clear understanding of his diagnosis and treatment options.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

I need some advice as to what I need to do.\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nI'm glad you're taking steps to address your bad breath concerns! Bad breath, also known as halitosis, can be embarrassing and may indicate an underlying health issue. Since you mentioned it can make yourself and others sick, I'll provide you with some advice and potential causes to consider.\n\n**Possible causes of bad breath:**\n\n1. **Poor oral hygiene**: Infrequent brushing, flossing, and tongue scraping can lead to the accumulation of bacteria, food particles, and plaque in your mouth.\n2. **Gum disease**: Gingivitis or periodontitis can cause bad breath, as bacteria in the mouth break down food and produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs).\n3. **Dry mouth**: A lack of saliva can contribute to bad breath, as saliva helps wash away bacteria and food particles.\n4. **Diet**: Consuming certain foods like garlic, onions, and cruciferous vegetables can lead to bad breath.\n5. **Medical conditions**: Respiratory infections, sinusitis, diabetes, kidney disease, and gastrointestinal issues can cause bad breath.\n6. **Medications**: Certain medications, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and decongestants, can reduce saliva production, leading to bad breath.\n\n**Steps to address bad breath:**\n\n1. **Practice good oral hygiene**:\n\t* Brush your teeth at least twice a day for 2 minutes with a fluoride toothpaste.\n\t* Floss once a day to remove food particles and plaque.\n\t* Use a tongue scraper to remove bacteria and debris from the surface of your tongue.\n2. **Visit your dentist**: Schedule a dental check-up to rule out any underlying oral health issues, such as gum disease or tooth decay.\n3. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help keep your mouth moist and wash away bacteria and food particles.\n4. **Chew sugar-free gum**: Chewing sugar-free gum can stimulate saliva production, which can help neutralize acids and wash away bacteria.\n5. **Avoid strong-smelling foods**: Limit or avoid foods that can cause bad breath, such as garlic and onions.\n6. **Consider a mouthwash**: Using a mouthwash that contains antibacterial ingredients, such as chlorhexidine, can help reduce bacteria and VSCs.\n7. **Consult a healthcare professional**: If your bad breath persists despite good oral hygiene and dental care, consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Avoid smoking and tobacco products, as they can contribute to bad breath and other health issues.\n* Consider using a humidifier to add moisture to the air, especially if you live in a dry climate.\n* If you wear dentures, clean them regularly and soak them in a denture cleaning solution.\n\nBy following these steps and consulting with your dentist and healthcare professional, you can help alleviate bad breath and prevent it from making yourself and others sick.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat is Bad Breath?: There are many reasons why you might have bad breath. You can get it if you don't brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as gum disease, dry mouth or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad aroma. Some diseases and medicines are associated with a specific breath odor. Having good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have an underlying disorder, treating it may help eliminate the breath odor.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse."

I'm happy to help you understand these treatment options.\n\n**TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) Therapy:**\nTMS is a non-invasive brain stimulation therapy used to treat depression, including treatment-resistant depression, and certain anxiety disorders. It involves applying magnetic fields to specific areas of the brain to stimulate brain activity.\n\nResearch suggests that TMS can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in some patients, including those with bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Studies have reported response rates ranging from 30% to 50% in patients with treatment-resistant depression, and some studies have specifically looked at TMS in patients with bipolar depression.\n\nA 2018 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that TMS significantly improved symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with bipolar disorder. Another study published in 2020 in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that TMS was effective in reducing symptoms of GAD.\n\n**ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy):**\nECT is a more established treatment for severe or treatment-resistant depression, mania, and other mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder. It involves the use of electrical impulses to induce a controlled seizure, which can help alleviate symptoms.\n\nECT has a long history of efficacy in treating severe depression, mania, and catatonia, including in patients with bipolar disorder. Studies have reported response rates ranging from 50% to 80% in patients with treatment-resistant depression. ECT can also be effective in treating anxiety disorders, including GAD.\n\nHowever, ECT is typically considered a last resort due to potential side effects, such as memory loss and confusion, which can be temporary or, in rare cases, persistent.\n\n**Acupuncture:**\nAcupuncture is an ancient practice that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate healing and balance. Some studies suggest that acupuncture may be helpful in alleviating symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mood disorders, including bipolar disorder.\n\nA 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Mood Disorders found that acupuncture was associated with significant improvements in depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder. Another study published in 2020 in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that acupuncture combined with medication was more effective than medication alone in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with GAD.\n\nWhile the exact mechanisms are unclear, acupuncture may help by:\n\n1. Stimulating the release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, which play a role in mood regulation.\n2. Modulating the body's stress response and inflammation.\n\n**Combining treatments:**\nIt's not uncommon for patients to use a combination of treatments, including medication, psychotherapy, and alternative therapies like acupuncture, to manage their symptoms.\n\nFor mixed bipolar and generalized anxiety disorder, a comprehensive treatment plan might involve:\n\n1. Medication: mood stabilizers, antidepressants, or anti-anxiety medications.\n2. Psychotherapy: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), or other forms of talk therapy.\n3. TMS or ECT: for patients with treatment-resistant symptoms or severe depression.\n4.

Given her age and diagnosis, it's essential to consider her overall health, medical history, and personal preferences when exploring treatment options after surgery. Here's a balanced view:\n\n**Treatment options after lumpectomy:**\n\n1. **Radiation therapy:** This is a common adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, especially for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or early-stage invasive cancer. However, for an 84-year-old woman, the decision to undergo radiation therapy should be weighed against potential side effects, such as fatigue, skin reactions, and the impact on her daily life. Short-course or hypofractionated radiation therapy may be considered to minimize treatment duration and side effects.\n\n2. **Hormone therapy:** If the tumor is estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), hormone therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) may be recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, the benefits and risks of hormone therapy should be carefully evaluated, especially considering her age and potential comorbidities.\n\n3. **Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB):** If the mass is invasive, an SLNB might be performed during the lumpectomy to assess if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. This can help guide further treatment.\n\n**Considerations specific to an 84-year-old woman:**\n\n* **Comorbidities:** Age often brings additional health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cognitive impairment.

More than 100 types of peripheral neuropathy have been identified, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms, pattern of development, and prognosis. Impaired function and symptoms depend on the type of nerves -- motor, sensory, or autonomic -- that are damaged.\u00a0 Some people may experience temporary numbness, tingling, and pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle weakness. Others may suffer more extreme symptoms, including burning pain (especially at night), muscle wasting, paralysis, or organ or gland dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathy may be either inherited or acquired. Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy include physical injury (trauma) to a nerve, tumors, toxins, autoimmune responses, nutritional deficiencies, alcoholism, medical procedures, and vascular and metabolic disorders. Acquired peripheral neuropathies are caused by systemic disease, trauma from external agents, or infections or autoimmune disorders affecting nerve tissue. Inherited forms of peripheral neuropathy are caused by inborn mistakes in the genetic code or by new genetic mutations."

More than 100 types of peripheral neuropathy have been identified, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms, pattern of development, and prognosis. Impaired function and symptoms depend on the type of nerves -- motor, sensory, or autonomic -- that are damaged.\u00a0 Some people may experience temporary numbness, tingling, and pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle weakness. Others may suffer more extreme symptoms, including burning pain (especially at night), muscle wasting, paralysis, or organ or gland dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathy may be either inherited or acquired. Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy include physical injury (trauma) to a nerve, tumors, toxins, autoimmune responses, nutritional deficiencies, alcoholism, medical procedures, and vascular and metabolic disorders. Acquired peripheral neuropathies are caused by systemic disease, trauma from external agents, or infections or autoimmune disorders affecting nerve tissue. Inherited forms of peripheral neuropathy are caused by inborn mistakes in the genetic code or by new genetic mutations.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more. Specific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include: - Antibiotics. These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic. - Cough medicine. This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it's a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest. - Fever reducers/pain relievers. You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort. These include drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Hospitalization You may need to be hospitalized if: - You are older than age 65 - You are confused about time, people or places - Your kidney function has declined - Your systolic blood pressure is below 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or your diastolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg or below - Your breathing is rapid (30 breaths or more a minute) - You need breathing assistance - Your temperature is below normal - Your heart rate is below 50 or above 100 You may be admitted to the intensive care unit if you need to be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator) or if your symptoms are severe. Children may be hospitalized if: - They are younger than age 2 months - They are lethargic or excessively sleepy - They have trouble breathing - They have low blood oxygen levels - They appear dehydrated"

The good news is that with proper treatment, pneumonia can be cured.\n\n**Is pneumonia infectious?**\nPneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and some of these can be contagious. However, the contagiousness of pneumonia depends on the underlying cause.\n\n* Bacterial pneumonia: Can be contagious if caused by bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. These bacteria can spread through respiratory droplets, such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n* Viral pneumonia: Can also be contagious, especially if caused by viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or adenovirus. These viruses can spread through respiratory droplets, contact with contaminated surfaces, or close contact with an infected person.\n* Fungal pneumonia: Typically not contagious, but can be spread through contaminated air or water.\n\n**Can pneumonia be totally cured?**\nYes, pneumonia can be cured with proper treatment, which usually involves:\n\n1. Antibiotics: For bacterial pneumonia, antibiotics are prescribed to target the specific bacteria causing the infection.\n2. Rest and hydration: Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids, and using a humidifier to relieve symptoms.\n3. Oxygen therapy: In severe cases, supplemental oxygen may be needed to help increase oxygen levels in the blood.\n\n**How can you help your friend?**\nHere are some ways to support your friend:\n\n1. **Encourage her to seek medical attention**: Pneumonia can be life-threatening, especially in vulnerable individuals, such as older adults, young children, or people with weakened immune systems.\n2. **Help with daily tasks**: Offer to help with daily tasks, such as grocery shopping, cooking, or cleaning, to reduce her workload and stress.\n3. **Support her treatment plan**: Help her remember to take her medication, attend doctor's appointments, and follow her treatment plan.\n4. **Provide emotional support**: Being sick can be stressful and scary. Listen to her concerns, offer reassurance, and provide emotional support.\n\n**Precautions to prevent transmission**\nIf your friend has a contagious form of pneumonia, take these precautions:\n\n1. **Wash your hands frequently**: Use soap and water or hand sanitizer to prevent the spread of germs.\n2. **Avoid close contact**: Try to maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from your friend to reduce the risk of transmission.\n3. **Wear a mask**: If you need to be in close proximity to your friend, wear a mask to reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n**Marriage and pneumonia**\nPneumonia is not a reason to delay marriage plans.

              "text": "Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Migraine and other types of headaches - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome - Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms."

              "text": "Cervical cancer: Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix. The cervix is\u00a0the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer\u00a0usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: - Having sex at an early age - Having multiple sexual partners - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: - Not getting the HPV vaccine - Being economically disadvantaged - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: - Back pain - Bone pain or fractures - Fatigue - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina - Leg pain - Loss of appetite - Pelvic pain - Single swollen leg - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions: - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis. - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination. - A procedure called a\u00a0cone biopsy may also be done. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include: - Chest x-ray - CT scan of the pelvis - Cystoscopy - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on: - The stage of the cancer - The size and shape of the tumor - The woman's age and general health - Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include: - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed. Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including: - Type of cervical cancer - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread) - Age and general health - If the cancer comes back after treatment Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include: - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you: - Have not had regular Pap smears - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

              "text": "Diabetes type 2 - meal planning (Function): Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has: - Food from all the food groups - Fewer calories - About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack - Healthy fats Along with healthy eating, you can help\u00a0keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. Persons with type 2 diabetes are often overweight. Losing just 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 30 to 60 minutes of walking per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food. The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day). Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition. The following tips can help your child stay on track: - No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep it in target range. - Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control. - Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk. PLANNING MEALS Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you. When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices. A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate. EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. VEGETABLES (2\u00bd to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day) Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro.\u00a0Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable. FRUITS (1\u00bd to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day) Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups. GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day) There are 2 types of grains: - Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa. - Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice. Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast. PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6\u00bd ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day) Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil. DAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day) Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label. OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day) Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature. Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter. Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters). WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS? If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you. Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small. Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets: - Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others. - Eat sweets that are sugar-free. - Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size. YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you."

Don't worry, I'm here to help.\n\n**Understanding the readings:**\n\n* A bedtime reading of 94 mg/dL is within the target range for most people with diabetes (usually considered < 130 mg/dL).\n* A morning reading of 165 mg/dL is higher than the target range.\n\n**Possible explanations:**\n\n1. **Dawn phenomenon**: This is a natural process where the body releases hormones, such as cortisol and growth hormone, in the early morning hours (around 2-8 am). These hormones can cause blood glucose levels to rise.\n2. **Overnight glucose release**: The liver stores glucose as glycogen and releases it into the bloodstream overnight. If the liver releases too much glucose, blood glucose levels can rise.\n3. **Dietary factors**: Although you mentioned you don't eat anything between dinner and morning, it's possible that your dinner is causing a delayed spike in glucose levels.\n\n**Strategies to lower morning blood glucose:**\n\n1. **Adjust your dinner**: Try to:\n\t* Eat a balanced dinner with protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.\n\t* Include fiber-rich foods, such as vegetables, fruits, or whole grains.\n\t* Limit or avoid high-carbohydrate or high-sugar foods close to bedtime.\n2. **Consider a small, healthy snack before bed**: A small snack can help prevent low blood glucose levels overnight and reduce the dawn phenomenon. Opt for something light, like:\n\t* A small apple or a handful of nuts\n\t* A hard-boiled egg or a slice of cheese\n\t* A few crackers with peanut butter or almond butter\n3. **Stay hydrated**: Drink water throughout the day and consider having a glass of water before bed.\n4. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve insulin sensitivity. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week.\n5. **Medication and insulin**: If you're taking medication or insulin, consult with your healthcare provider about adjusting your regimen to better manage your morning blood glucose levels.\n6. **Monitor and adjust**: Keep track of your blood glucose levels, including the timing of your readings, and adjust your strategies as needed.\n\n**Consult your healthcare provider**:\n\nDiscuss your specific situation with your healthcare provider to:\n\n* Review your medication and insulin regimen (if applicable)\n* Get personalized guidance on managing your blood glucose levels\n* Identify any underlying factors contributing to your morning hyperglycemia",

People with SPS respond to high doses of diazepam and several anti-convulsants, gabapentin and tiagabine.\u00a0\u00a0A recent study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and stress in people with SPS.\u00a0 Treatment with IVIg, anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and pain relievers will improve the symptoms of SPS, but will not cure the disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Most individuals with SPS have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe.\u00a0\u00a0With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled."

Please can you tell me what are the early symptoms I have severe cramps in my feet which are twisting into an arc,muscle spasms slowly getting worse and my muscles particularly in my legs are cramping like someone has pushed a knitting needle into them. Started off at night but now happening through the day my back and neck and voice box are also effected and my chest area has now seized to the point of restricting my breathing to very shallow at times I find that I am stretching out involuntarily right through my body and this is becoming more frequent\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nI'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) and its symptoms. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nStiff Person Syndrome is a rare and chronic neurological disorder characterized by progressive stiffness and rigidity of the muscles, leading to impaired mobility and other symptoms. The early symptoms you've described are consistent with SPS, but a thorough medical evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe symptoms you've mentioned, such as:\n\n1. **Severe cramps in feet**: Muscle spasms and cramping in the feet, which can cause the feet to twist into an arc.\n2. **Muscle spasms and cramping**: Muscle spasms that worsen over time, with cramping sensations like someone pushing a knitting needle into the muscles.\n3. **Involuntary stretching**: Involuntary stretching throughout the body, which is becoming more frequent.\n4. **Affected areas**: Symptoms spreading to the back, neck, voice box, and chest area, which can restrict breathing.\n\nare all potential indicators of Stiff Person Syndrome.\n\nOther common symptoms of SPS include:\n\n* Gradual onset of stiffness and rigidity in the muscles\n* Sensitivity to noise, stress, or other environmental factors\n* Difficulty walking or maintaining posture\n* Muscle spasms triggered by stress, anxiety, or fatigue\n* Autonomic dysfunction (e.g., changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or digestion)\n\nIt's crucial to seek medical attention from a qualified healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist or a specialist in movement disorders. They will:\n\n1. Conduct a thorough medical history and physical examination.\n2. Perform diagnostic tests, such as electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scans).\n3. Evaluate your symptoms and rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.\n\nWhile there is no cure for SPS, various treatments can help manage symptoms, such as:\n\n* Medications: benzodiazepines, baclofen, and other muscle relaxants\n* Physical therapy: to maintain mobility and flexibility\n* Occupational therapy: to adapt to daily activities and manage stress\n* Alternative therapies: acupuncture, massage, or relaxation techniques\n\nPlease consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and develop a treatment plan. They will help you determine the best course of action to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nStiff-Person Syndrome: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0SPS is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms.\u00a0\u00a0Abnormal postures, often hunched over and stiffened, are characteristic of the disorder.\u00a0\u00a0People with SPS can be too disabled to walk or move, or they are afraid to leave the house because street noises, such as the sound of a horn, can trigger spasms and falls.\u00a0\u00a0SPS affects twice as many women as men.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, thyroiditis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia.\u00a0\u00a0Scientists don\u2019t yet understand what causes SPS, but research indicates that it is the result of an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0The disorder is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, psychosomatic illness, or anxiety and phobia.\u00a0\u00a0A definitive diagnosis can be made with a blood test that measures the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0People with SPS have elevated levels of GAD, an antibody that works against an enzyme involved in the synthesis of an important neurotransmitter in the brain. People with SPS respond to high doses of diazepam and several anti-convulsants, gabapentin and tiagabine.\u00a0\u00a0A recent study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and stress in people with SPS.\u00a0 Treatment with IVIg, anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and pain relievers will improve the symptoms of SPS, but will not cure the disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Most individuals with SPS have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe.\u00a0\u00a0With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1 in 2,500 newborns. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified. Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.

              "text": "Colon cancer (Treatment): The type of treatment your doctor recommends will depend largely on the stage of your cancer. The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy may be used before surgery as well, with the goal of shrinking the cancer before an operation. Chemotherapy before surgery is more common in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. Chemotherapy can also be given to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells, to shrink large tumors before an operation so that they can be removed more easily, or to relieve symptoms of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Radiation therapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options for the initial management of rectal cancer followed by surgery. Targeted drug therapy Drugs that target specific malfunctions that allow cancer cells to grow are available to people with advanced colon cancer, including: - Bevacizumab (Avastin) - Cetuximab (Erbitux) - Panitumumab (Vectibix) - Ramucirumab (Cyramza) - Regorafenib (Stivarga) - Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) Targeted drugs can be given along with chemotherapy or alone. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs.

The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy may be used before surgery as well, with the goal of shrinking the cancer before an operation. Chemotherapy before surgery is more common in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. Chemotherapy can also be given to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells, to shrink large tumors before an operation so that they can be removed more easily, or to relieve symptoms of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Radiation therapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options for the initial management of rectal cancer followed by surgery. Targeted drug therapy Drugs that target specific malfunctions that allow cancer cells to grow are available to people with advanced colon cancer, including: - Bevacizumab (Avastin) - Cetuximab (Erbitux) - Panitumumab (Vectibix) - Ramucirumab (Cyramza) - Regorafenib (Stivarga) - Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) Targeted drugs can be given along with chemotherapy or alone. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs. Until more is known, doctors carefully weigh the possible benefit of targeted drugs against the risk of side effects and the cost when deciding whether to use these treatments. Immunotherapy Some patients with advanced colon cancer have a chance to benefit from immunotherapy with antibodies such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo). Whether a colon cancer has the chance to respond to these immunotherapies can be determined by a specific test of the tumor tissue. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness.

If you've tried lifestyle changes and home remedies for diarrhea without success, your doctor might recommend medications or other treatments. Antibiotics Antibiotics might help treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. If a virus is causing your diarrhea, antibiotics won't help. Treatment to replace fluids Your doctor likely will advise you to replace the fluids and salts. For most adults, that means drinking water, juice or broth. If drinking liquids upsets your stomach or causes diarrhea, your doctor might recommend getting fluids through a vein in your arm (intravenously). Water is a good way to replace fluids, but it doesn't contain the salts and electrolytes - minerals such as sodium and potassium - you need to maintain the electric currents that keep your heart beating. You can help maintain your electrolyte levels by drinking fruit juices for potassium or eating soups for sodium. Certain fruit juices, such as apple juice, might make diarrhea worse. For children, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to prevent dehydration or replace lost fluids. Adjusting medications you're taking If your doctor determines that an antibiotic caused your diarrhea, your doctor might lower your dose or switch to another medication. Treating underlying conditions If your diarrhea is caused by a more serious condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, your doctor will work to control that condition. You might be referred to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, who can help devise a treatment plan for you."

Some popular options include:\n\n* Loperamide (Imodium): This medication works by slowing down bowel movements to allow more water and electrolytes to be absorbed.\n* Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol): This medication can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that may be causing diarrhea.\n\nYou can also try some home remedies to help manage diarrhea, such as:\n\n* Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broths, or electrolyte-rich beverages like coconut water or sports drinks.\n* Avoiding caffeine, fatty foods, and spicy foods that can exacerbate diarrhea.\n* Eating bland foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT diet).\n\nIf your diarrhea persists or worsens, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment. They can help you determine the underlying cause of your diarrhea and provide guidance on the best course of treatment.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nDiarrhea (Treatment): Most cases of diarrhea clear on their own within a couple of days without treatment. If you've tried lifestyle changes and home remedies for diarrhea without success, your doctor might recommend medications or other treatments. Antibiotics Antibiotics might help treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. If a virus is causing your diarrhea, antibiotics won't help. Treatment to replace fluids Your doctor likely will advise you to replace the fluids and salts. For most adults, that means drinking water, juice or broth. If drinking liquids upsets your stomach or causes diarrhea, your doctor might recommend getting fluids through a vein in your arm (intravenously). Water is a good way to replace fluids, but it doesn't contain the salts and electrolytes - minerals such as sodium and potassium - you need to maintain the electric currents that keep your heart beating. You can help maintain your electrolyte levels by drinking fruit juices for potassium or eating soups for sodium. Certain fruit juices, such as apple juice, might make diarrhea worse. For children, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to prevent dehydration or replace lost fluids. Adjusting medications you're taking If your doctor determines that an antibiotic caused your diarrhea, your doctor might lower your dose or switch to another medication. Treating underlying conditions If your diarrhea is caused by a more serious condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, your doctor will work to control that condition. You might be referred to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, who can help devise a treatment plan for you.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. DMD causes progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of skeletal and heart muscles. [1] Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. The calves may be enlarged. Children with DMD may have an unusual walk and difficulty running, climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor. [2] DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills. [3] Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. [2] DMD is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the DMD gene . The DMD gene codes for the protein dystrophin. [1] [2] Dystrophin is mainly made in skeletal and heart muscle cells , but a small amount is also made in nerve cells\u00a0(neurons) in specific parts of the brain. [3] DMD is\u00a0 inherited in an X-linked recessive \u00a0pattern; however, it\u00a0may also\u00a0occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. [2]\u00a0 While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. [4] Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood. [2] [3] Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) is also caused by mutations in the DMD gene. People with BMD have less severe symptoms than DMD. In addition, symptoms start later in childhood or in adolescence and progress more slowly. [1] Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually noticed in boys between 1 to 6 years of age. There is a steady decline in muscle strength between the ages of 6 and 11 years. By age 10, braces may be required for walking, and by age 13, most boys with DMD are confined to a wheelchair. The signs and symptoms are as follows: [1] [2] [3] Taking longer to learn to sit, stand, or walk on own, which is known as delayed motor development. The mean age for walking in boys with DMD is 18 months. Having a waddling walk or gait, difficulty climbing stairs, and running due to progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvic muscles and progressive loss of muscle mass (wasting or atrophy).\u00a0 Difficulty getting up from the floor. Child may walk his hands up his legs to stand which is known as the\u00a0Gower maneuver. Enlargement of calf muscles due to the calf muscle cells being\u00a0 Muscle weakness first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. Tight or rigid joints (also known as contractures ) may develop as muscle loss progresses. If not treated, these will become severe, causing discomfort and restricting mobility and flexibility. Contractures can affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. Scoliosis may develop within several years of being confined to a wheelchair. By the early teens, the respiratory and heart muscles are also affected. Breathing problems due to weakness of the diaphragm and the other muscles supporting the operation of the lungs. Skeletal changes, such as scoliosis, may also increase breathing problems. Breathing problems may become life threatening. Progressive enlargement of the heart ( cardiomyopathy ) develops. This stops the heart from pumping blood efficiently, and becomes life-threatening in many cases. Learning and memory issues (cognitive impairment) may occur in some cases, but do not worsen as the DMD progresses. Communication may be more difficult for some. Social behavior may be affected, as well as the ability to read facial cues.\u00a0\u00a0 The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene . The DMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. Dystophin is primarily made in the muscle cells of the heart and skeletal muscle. The main job of dystrophin in muscle cells is to help stabilize and protect muscle fibers. [1] [2] [3]\u00a0 DMD is caused by genetic changes in the DMD gene that stop any functional dystrophin from being made. [2] When dystrophin is missing, the muscle cells become damaged more easily. In response to the damage, inflammation occurs, which only worsens the process. Over time, the muscle cells without dystrophin weaken and die, leading to the muscle weakness and heart problems seen in DMD. [2] [3] The non-progressive memory and learning problems, as well as social behavioral problems, in some boys with DMD are most likely linked to loss of dystrophin in the neurons of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain where dystrophin is normally produced in small amounts, but at this point it is not known why this occurs and why only some people with DMD have these problems. [3]\u00a0 Different genetic changes in the DMD gene can cause a spectrum of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. The dystrophinopathies can range from very mild symptoms to the more severe symptoms seen in people with DMD. Other dystrophinopathies include Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). [2] Genetic changes causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be passed down in families. The DMD gene is located on the X chromosome , one of the two types of sex chromosomes . Males have an X and a Y chromosome ; whereas females have two X chromosomes . Since males only have one X chromosome, they also only have one copy of the DMD gene. If this copy has a genetic change that causes DMD, the male will have DMD. Males get their X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father. [1] [2]\u00a0 Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the DMD gene. Having two changed copies of the DMD gene that can cause DMD is unlikely, but would cause DMD in females. A female with only one changed copy of the DMD gene is called a \" carrier \". She can pass on the changed gene, but usually does not have symptoms of DMD. Carriers of changes in the DMD gene that can cause DMD are at an increased risk of developing heart problems, including cardiomyopathy . In addition, due to a process called X-inactivation , in rare cases, female carriers may have mild, moderate, or severe DMD. [2] If a man with DMD has children, all of his daughters will be carriers. Since boys inherit the Y chromosome from their father, sons will not inherit DMD from their fathers, even if the father has DMD. [1] [2] DMD DMD DMD DMD A child's doctor may suspect Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys who have the signs and symptoms of DMD, including progressive muscle weakness. Family history is also important. Blood tests can be used to check for\u00a0 increased levels of certain special proteins called muscle enzymes in the blood which can leak from damaged muscles. Most commonly, the blood level of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) is checked, but a doctor may also check the blood levels of transaminases such as aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Finding a change in the DMD gene that can cause DMD through genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of DMD. [2] [5]\u00a0\u00a0 Testing for DMD may include: [2] [5]\u00a0 Blood test which measures the levels of serum creatine phosphokinase Molecular genetic testing Electromyography Muscle biopsy is rarely used to diagnose DMD due to the decreased cost and higher accuracy of genetic testing. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life.\u00a0An enlarged, weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a\u00a0 heart transplant\u00a0may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. [2] [6] Physical therapy Steroids\u00a0( corticosteroids ) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function. Steroid options include: [2] [6] Prednisone \u00a0is\u00a0a steroid that has been shown to extend the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain, high blood pressure , behavior changes, and delayed growth. Deflazacort (another form of prednisone), is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects and was recently approved in the United States by the FDA. Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, also has similar benefits to prednisone, but with fewer side effects. Management Guidelines Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

I'm happy to provide you with information on the mode of inheritance, symptoms, treatments, support groups, and relative cost to families.\n\n**Mode of Inheritance:**\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. The gene, dystrophin, is essential for muscle function, and mutations in this gene lead to the development of DMD. The disorder primarily affects males, as they have only one X chromosome. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, and if one X chromosome has the mutated gene, the other X chromosome can compensate, making them less likely to express the full symptoms of the disorder. However, females can be carriers of the mutated gene and pass it on to their offspring.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nThe symptoms of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy typically appear in early childhood, around 2-5 years of age. The initial symptoms may include:\n\n* Muscle weakness in the legs, arms, and trunk\n* Delayed motor skills, such as walking, running, and jumping\n* Frequent falls\n* Difficulty getting up from a lying or sitting position\n* Muscle cramps and stiffness\n* Enlarged calf muscles (pseudohypertrophy)\n\nAs the disease progresses, children with DMD may experience:\n\n* Loss of muscle mass and strength\n* Decreased mobility and independence\n* Respiratory problems, such as breathing difficulties and pneumonia\n* Cardiac problems, such as cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias\n\n**Treatments:**\nWhile there is no cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, various treatments can help manage the symptoms and slow down disease progression. These include:\n\n* Corticosteroids to slow down muscle degeneration\n* Physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and mobility\n* Occupational therapy to adapt to daily activities\n* Respiratory therapy to manage breathing difficulties\n* Cardiac monitoring and management to prevent cardiac complications\n* Genetic counseling to help families understand the disorder and make informed reproductive decisions\n\n**Support Groups:**\nSeveral support groups and organizations provide resources, guidance, and emotional support to families affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Some notable organizations include:\n\n* The Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Association (DMD Association)\n* The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)\n* The Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD)\n* The Duchenne Registry\n\n**Relative Cost to Family:**\nThe cost of caring for a child with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy can be significant. According to a study published in the Journal of Child Neurology, the estimated annual cost of caring for a child with DMD in the United States is around $300,000 to $400,000. This includes:\n\n* Medical expenses, such as hospitalizations, surgeries, and therapies\n* Medications, such as corticosteroids and other treatments\n* Equipment, such as wheelchairs and respiratory therapy devices\n* Home care and caregiving services\n* Lost productivity and income for caregivers\n\nThe emotional and psychological impact on families should not be underestimated. Caring for a child with DMD requires significant time, effort, and resources, which can affect family dynamics, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\nI hope this information helps with your research project on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, and if one X chromosome has the mutated gene, the other X chromosome can compensate, making them less likely to express the full symptoms of the disorder. However, females can be carriers of the mutated gene and pass it on to their offspring.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nThe symptoms of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy typically appear in early childhood, around 2-5 years of age. The initial symptoms may include:\n\n* Muscle weakness in the legs, arms, and trunk\n* Delayed motor skills, such as walking, running, and jumping\n* Frequent falls\n* Difficulty getting up from a lying or sitting position\n* Muscle cramps and stiffness\n* Enlarged calf muscles (pseudohypertrophy)\n\nAs the disease progresses, children with DMD may experience:\n\n* Loss of muscle mass and strength\n* Decreased mobility and independence\n* Respiratory problems, such as breathing difficulties and pneumonia\n* Cardiac problems, such as cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias\n\n**Treatments:**\nWhile there is no cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, various treatments can help manage the symptoms and slow down disease progression. These include:\n\n* Corticosteroids to slow down muscle degeneration\n* Physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and mobility\n* Occupational therapy to adapt to daily activities\n* Respiratory therapy to manage breathing difficulties\n* Cardiac monitoring and management to prevent cardiac complications\n* Genetic counseling to help families understand the disorder and make informed reproductive decisions\n\n**Support Groups:**\nSeveral support groups and organizations provide resources, guidance, and emotional support to families affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Some notable organizations include:\n\n* The Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Association (DMD Association)\n* The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)\n* The Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD)\n* The Duchenne Registry\n\n**Relative Cost to Family:**\nThe cost of caring for a child with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy can be significant. According to a study published in the Journal of Child Neurology, the estimated annual cost of caring for a child with DMD in the United States is around $300,000 to $400,000. This includes:\n\n* Medical expenses, such as hospitalizations, surgeries, and therapies\n* Medications, such as corticosteroids and other treatments\n* Equipment, such as wheelchairs and respiratory therapy devices\n* Home care and caregiving services\n* Lost productivity and income for caregivers\n\nThe emotional and psychological impact on families should not be underestimated. Caring for a child with DMD requires significant time, effort, and resources, which can affect family dynamics, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\nI hope this information helps with your research project on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. If you have any further questions or need more specific information, feel free to ask!\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. DMD causes progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of skeletal and heart muscles. [1] Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. The calves may be enlarged. Children with DMD may have an unusual walk and difficulty running, climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor. [2] DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills. [3] Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. [2] DMD is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the DMD gene . The DMD gene codes for the protein dystrophin. [1] [2] Dystrophin is mainly made in skeletal and heart muscle cells , but a small amount is also made in nerve cells\u00a0(neurons) in specific parts of the brain. [3] DMD is\u00a0 inherited in an X-linked recessive \u00a0pattern; however, it\u00a0may also\u00a0occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. [2]\u00a0 While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. [4] Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood. [2] [3] Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) is also caused by mutations in the DMD gene. People with BMD have less severe symptoms than DMD. In addition, symptoms start later in childhood or in adolescence and progress more slowly. [1] Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually noticed in boys between 1 to 6 years of age. There is a steady decline in muscle strength between the ages of 6 and 11 years. By age 10, braces may be required for walking, and by age 13, most boys with DMD are confined to a wheelchair. The signs and symptoms are as follows: [1] [2] [3] Taking longer to learn to sit, stand, or walk on own, which is known as delayed motor development. The mean age for walking in boys with DMD is 18 months. Having a waddling walk or gait, difficulty climbing stairs, and running due to progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvic muscles and progressive loss of muscle mass (wasting or atrophy).\u00a0 Difficulty getting up from the floor. Child may walk his hands up his legs to stand which is known as the\u00a0Gower maneuver. Enlargement of calf muscles due to the calf muscle cells being\u00a0 Muscle weakness first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. Tight or rigid joints (also known as contractures ) may develop as muscle loss progresses. If not treated, these will become severe, causing discomfort and restricting mobility and flexibility. Contractures can affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. Scoliosis may develop within several years of being confined to a wheelchair. By the early teens, the respiratory and heart muscles are also affected. Breathing problems due to weakness of the diaphragm and the other muscles supporting the operation of the lungs. Skeletal changes, such as scoliosis, may also increase breathing problems. Breathing problems may become life threatening. Progressive enlargement of the heart ( cardiomyopathy ) develops. This stops the heart from pumping blood efficiently, and becomes life-threatening in many cases. Learning and memory issues (cognitive impairment) may occur in some cases, but do not worsen as the DMD progresses. Communication may be more difficult for some. Social behavior may be affected, as well as the ability to read facial cues.\u00a0\u00a0 The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene . The DMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. Dystophin is primarily made in the muscle cells of the heart and skeletal muscle. The main job of dystrophin in muscle cells is to help stabilize and protect muscle fibers. [1] [2] [3]\u00a0 DMD is caused by genetic changes in the DMD gene that stop any functional dystrophin from being made. [2] When dystrophin is missing, the muscle cells become damaged more easily. In response to the damage, inflammation occurs, which only worsens the process. Over time, the muscle cells without dystrophin weaken and die, leading to the muscle weakness and heart problems seen in DMD. [2] [3] The non-progressive memory and learning problems, as well as social behavioral problems, in some boys with DMD are most likely linked to loss of dystrophin in the neurons of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain where dystrophin is normally produced in small amounts, but at this point it is not known why this occurs and why only some people with DMD have these problems. [3]\u00a0 Different genetic changes in the DMD gene can cause a spectrum of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. The dystrophinopathies can range from very mild symptoms to the more severe symptoms seen in people with DMD. Other dystrophinopathies include Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). [2] Genetic changes causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be passed down in families. The DMD gene is located on the X chromosome , one of the two types of sex chromosomes . Males have an X and a Y chromosome ; whereas females have two X chromosomes . Since males only have one X chromosome, they also only have one copy of the DMD gene. If this copy has a genetic change that causes DMD, the male will have DMD. Males get their X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father. [1] [2]\u00a0 Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the DMD gene. Having two changed copies of the DMD gene that can cause DMD is unlikely, but would cause DMD in females. A female with only one changed copy of the DMD gene is called a \" carrier \". She can pass on the changed gene, but usually does not have symptoms of DMD. Carriers of changes in the DMD gene that can cause DMD are at an increased risk of developing heart problems, including cardiomyopathy . In addition, due to a process called X-inactivation , in rare cases, female carriers may have mild, moderate, or severe DMD. [2] If a man with DMD has children, all of his daughters will be carriers. Since boys inherit the Y chromosome from their father, sons will not inherit DMD from their fathers, even if the father has DMD. [1] [2] DMD DMD DMD DMD A child's doctor may suspect Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys who have the signs and symptoms of DMD, including progressive muscle weakness. Family history is also important. Blood tests can be used to check for\u00a0 increased levels of certain special proteins called muscle enzymes in the blood which can leak from damaged muscles. Most commonly, the blood level of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) is checked, but a doctor may also check the blood levels of transaminases such as aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Finding a change in the DMD gene that can cause DMD through genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of DMD. [2] [5]\u00a0\u00a0 Testing for DMD may include: [2] [5]\u00a0 Blood test which measures the levels of serum creatine phosphokinase Molecular genetic testing Electromyography Muscle biopsy is rarely used to diagnose DMD due to the decreased cost and higher accuracy of genetic testing. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life.\u00a0An enlarged, weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a\u00a0 heart transplant\u00a0may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. [2] [6] Physical therapy Steroids\u00a0( corticosteroids ) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function. Steroid options include: [2] [6] Prednisone \u00a0is\u00a0a steroid that has been shown to extend the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain, high blood pressure , behavior changes, and delayed growth. Deflazacort (another form of prednisone), is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects and was recently approved in the United States by the FDA. Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, also has similar benefits to prednisone, but with fewer side effects. Management Guidelines Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

              "text": "Esophageal cancer: Esophageal cancer is cancer that starts in the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope. Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include any of the following: - Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation) - Chest pain not related to eating - Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids - Heartburn - Vomiting blood - Weight loss Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include: - Barium swallow - Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease) - Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease) - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy - PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible) Stool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool. Upper endoscopy (EGD) will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery will be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using: - Open surgery, during which one or two larger incisions are made. - Minimally invasive surgery, during which a 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions. Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus. Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable. Beside a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include: - Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open. - A feeding tube into the stomach. - Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival. When the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Complications may include: - Pneumonia - Severe weight loss from not eating enough Call your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better. Also call if you have other symptoms of esophageal cancer. To reduce your risk of cancer of the esophagus: - DO NOT smoke - Limit or DO NOT drink alcoholic beverages - Get checked by your doctor if you have severe GERD - Get regular checkups if you have Barrett esophagus Updated by: Subodh K.

Esophageal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the esophagus, a muscular tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach.\n\n**What is Esophageal Cancer?**\n\nEsophageal cancer is a type of malignant tumor that develops in the lining of the esophagus. There are two main types of esophageal cancer:\n\n1. **Squamous cell carcinoma**: This type of cancer develops in the lining of the esophagus, usually in the upper or middle part of the esophagus.\n2. **Adenocarcinoma**: This type of cancer develops in the glandular cells of the esophagus, usually in the lower part of the esophagus.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of esophageal cancer are not known, but there are several risk factors that may increase a person's chance of developing the disease. These include:\n\n* **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Chronic acid reflux can cause inflammation and damage to the esophageal lining, increasing the risk of cancer.\n* **Smoking**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for esophageal cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma.\n* **Obesity**: Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer.\n* **Diet**: A diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in processed meats may increase the risk of esophageal cancer.\n* **Age**: Esophageal cancer is more common in people over 60 years old.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of esophageal cancer may not appear until the disease is advanced. Common symptoms include:\n\n* **Difficulty swallowing**: Feeling like food is getting stuck in the throat or chest.\n* **Weight loss**: Unexplained weight loss due to difficulty swallowing or other factors.\n* **Chest pain**: Pain or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen.\n* **Regurgitation of food**: Food coming back up into the throat or mouth.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nIf esophageal cancer is suspected, a doctor may perform the following tests:\n\n* **Endoscopy**: A flexible tube with a camera and light is inserted through the mouth to visualize the esophagus.\n* **Biopsy**: A tissue sample is taken from the esophagus to check for cancer cells.\n* **Imaging tests**: CT scans, MRI scans, or PET scans may be used to determine the extent of the cancer.\n\nTreatment options for esophageal cancer depend on the stage and location of the cancer and may include:\n\n* **Surgery**: Removing the cancerous portion of the esophagus or the entire esophagus.\n* **Chemotherapy**: Using medications to kill cancer cells.\n* **Radiation therapy**: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no sure way to prevent esophageal cancer, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n* **Quit smoking**: Smoking cessation can significantly reduce the risk of esophageal cancer.\n* **Maintain a healthy weight**: Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of esophageal cancer.\n* **Eat a balanced diet**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may help reduce the risk of esophageal cancer.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope. Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include any of the following: - Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation) - Chest pain not related to eating - Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids - Heartburn - Vomiting blood - Weight loss Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include: - Barium swallow - Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease) - Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease) - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy - PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible) Stool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool. Upper endoscopy (EGD) will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery will be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using: - Open surgery, during which one or two larger incisions are made. - Minimally invasive surgery, during which a 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions. Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus. Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable. Beside a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include: - Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open. - A feeding tube into the stomach. - Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival. When the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Complications may include: - Pneumonia - Severe weight loss from not eating enough Call your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better. Also call if you have other symptoms of esophageal cancer. To reduce your risk of cancer of the esophagus: - DO NOT smoke - Limit or DO NOT drink alcoholic beverages - Get checked by your doctor if you have severe GERD - Get regular checkups if you have Barrett esophagus Updated by: Subodh K.

IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) can be a challenging condition to manage, and weight loss, weakness, and fainting are concerning symptoms that need attention.\n\nFirstly, I want to emphasize that it's essential to consult a healthcare professional, such as a gastroenterologist or a primary care physician, for personalized guidance and treatment. That being said, I'll provide some general suggestions that may help.\n\n**Immediate concerns:**\n\n1. **Seek medical attention**: Given your father's symptoms of fainting, weakness, and significant weight loss, it's crucial to consult a doctor urgently to rule out any underlying conditions that may require immediate medical attention.\n2. **Malnutrition risk**: With IBS and poor digestion, your father may be at risk of malnutrition. Ensure he's getting enough nutrients, and consider consulting a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional for guidance.\n\n**IBS management and digestive health:**\n\n1. **Keep a food diary**: Encourage your father to track his food intake, symptoms, and bowel movements to identify potential trigger foods or patterns.\n2. **Dietary changes**: Suggest a low-FODMAP diet (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides, and Polyols), which may help alleviate IBS symptoms. This diet involves limiting or avoiding certain types of carbohydrates that can be difficult to digest.\n3. **Eat smaller, more frequent meals**: Divide daily food intake into 4-6 smaller meals to ease digestion and reduce symptoms.\n4. **Avoid trigger foods**: Common trigger foods for IBS include beans, cabbage, broccoli, onions, wheat, dairy products, and spicy or fatty foods.\n5. **Stay hydrated**: Encourage your father to drink plenty of water and consider electrolyte-rich beverages, like coconut water or sports drinks, to help manage electrolyte imbalances.\n6. **Probiotics**: Consider adding probiotics to his diet, as they may help regulate gut bacteria and alleviate IBS symptoms. However, consult a healthcare professional before starting any supplements.\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n1. **Ensure adequate caloric intake**: Encourage your father to consume calorie-rich foods, such as nuts, dried fruits, avocados, and full-fat dairy products, to help maintain weight.\n2. **Consider supplements**: Depending on your father's specific needs, a healthcare professional may recommend supplements like vitamin B12, iron, or other essential nutrients.\n3. **Manage stress**: Stress can exacerbate IBS symptoms. Suggest stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Consult a healthcare professional**: Schedule an appointment with a doctor or gastroenterologist to discuss your father's symptoms and develop a personalized treatment plan.\n2. **Follow-up appointments**: Regular follow-up appointments will help monitor progress, adjust treatment plans as needed, and address any concerns.\n\nPlease encourage your father to seek medical attention as soon as possible to address his concerning symptoms.

The capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint.

Risk factors include: - Diabetes - Thyroid problems - Changes in your hormones, such as during menopause - Shoulder injury - Shoulder surgery - Open heart surgery - Cervical disk disease of the neck - Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected Main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are: - Decreased motion of the shoulder - Pain - Stiffness Frozen shoulder without any known cause starts with pain. This pain prevents you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you. Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made when you are not able to rotate your shoulder. You may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an MRI exam shows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder. Pain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion. It can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 6 to 9 months for complete recovery. Physical therapy is intense and needs to be done every day. Left untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little loss of motion. Risk factors for frozen shoulder, such as diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated. Surgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (shoulder arthroscopy) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy. Follow instructions on caring for your shoulder at home.\u00a0 Treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years. After surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you\u00a0do not\u00a0keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back. Complications may include: - Stiffness and pain continue even with therapy - The arm can break if the shoulder is moved forcefully during surgery If you have shoulder pain and stiffness and think you have a frozen shoulder, contact your provider for referral and treatment. Early treatment may help prevent stiffness. Call your provider if you develop shoulder pain that limits your range of motion for an extended period. People who have diabetes or thyroid problems will be less likely to get frozen shoulder if they keep their condition under control. Updated by: C.

The capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint. Most of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Risk factors include: - Diabetes - Thyroid problems - Changes in your hormones, such as during menopause - Shoulder injury - Shoulder surgery - Open heart surgery - Cervical disk disease of the neck - Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected Main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are: - Decreased motion of the shoulder - Pain - Stiffness Frozen shoulder without any known cause starts with pain.

              "text": "Gastroparesis: Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis includegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetitegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomachpain in the stomach areaabdominal bloatinglack of appetiteSymptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.

The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.Upper GI series.Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis.Ultrasound.Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed.Gastric emptying scintigraphy.SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract.SmartPill.Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Gastric emptying breath test. Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.MedicationsSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement.Metoclopramide (Reglan).Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.Erythromycin.Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.Other medications.Botulinum ToxinBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.11Gastric Electrical StimulationThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.JejunostomyIf medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe.Parenteral NutritionWhen gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen.To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need totake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessarytake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they taketake insulin after meals, instead of beforecheck blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessaryA health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis.In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. The problems of gastroparesis can includesevere dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptomssevere dehydration due to persistent vomitinggastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagusbezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill formdifficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetesmalnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intakedecreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition.

Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. What causes gastroparesis? Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetite Symptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. How is gastroparesis diagnosed? Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy.

What are the problems of gastroparesis? The problems of gastroparesis can include severe dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Points to Remember Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.

Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis includegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetitegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomachpain in the stomach areaabdominal bloatinglack of appetiteSymptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.

Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Gastric emptying breath test. Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.MedicationsSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement.Metoclopramide (Reglan).Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.Erythromycin.Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.Other medications.Botulinum ToxinBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.11Gastric Electrical StimulationThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.JejunostomyIf medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe.Parenteral NutritionWhen gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen.To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need totake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessarytake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they taketake insulin after meals, instead of beforecheck blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessaryA health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis.In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. The problems of gastroparesis can includesevere dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptomssevere dehydration due to persistent vomitinggastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagusbezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill formdifficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetesmalnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intakedecreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite.

Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve.The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite.Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests.Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones.

Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. What causes gastroparesis? Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetite Symptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. How is gastroparesis diagnosed? Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying. How is gastroparesis treated? Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying. A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met. When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given. Medications Several prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment. Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement. Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting. Botulinum Toxin Botulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.1 Gastric Electrical Stimulation This treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms. Jejunostomy If medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe. Parenteral Nutrition When gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. How is gastroparesis treated if a person has diabetes? An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control. The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen. To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need to take insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessary A health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis. In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. What are the problems of gastroparesis? The problems of gastroparesis can include severe dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Points to Remember Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal.

              "text": "Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain. Most often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure. Watch this video about: Glaucoma Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma: - Open-angle glaucoma - Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma - Congenital glaucoma - Secondary glaucoma The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye. - In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow. - In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden. - Either type can damage the optic nerve. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. - The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it. - The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision. - Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. - Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack. - Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency. - If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your health care provider is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye. Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: - Drugs such as corticosteroids - Eye diseases such as uveitis (an infection of the middle layer of the eye) - Diseases such as diabetes - Eye injury Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies. - It often runs in families. - It is present at birth. - It is caused when the eye does not develop normally. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - Most people have no symptoms. - Once vision loss occurs, the damage is already severe. - Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision). - Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness. ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: - Sudden, severe pain in one eye - Decreased or cloudy vision, often called \"steamy\" vision - Nausea and vomiting - Rainbow-like halos around lights - Red eye - Eye feels swollen CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old. - Cloudiness of the front of the eye - Enlargement of one eye or both eyes - Red eye - Sensitivity to light - Tearing SECONDARY GLAUCOMA - Symptoms are most often related to the underlying problem causing the glaucoma. - Depending on the cause, symptoms may either be like open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. - You will be given a test to check your eye pressure. This is called tonometry. - In most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil. - When your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve. Eye pressure is different at different times of the day. Eye pressure can even be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include: - Using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy). - Photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of your eye (optic nerve imaging). - Checking your retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. - Checking how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response). - 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination). - Testing the clearness of your vision (visual acuity). - Testing your field of vision (visual field measurement). The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA - If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops. - You may need more than one type. Most people can be treated with eye drops. - Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past. - You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye. If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment: - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out. - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure. - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack. - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack. CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery. - This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain. SECONDARY GLAUCOMA If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions. Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision. Babies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early. How you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition. If you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma. You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. But you can help prevent vision loss. - A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. - All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. - If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40. - You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss. Updated by: Franklin W.

If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment: - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out. - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure. - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack. - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack. CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery. - This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain. SECONDARY GLAUCOMA If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions. Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision. Babies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early. How you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition. If you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma. You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. But you can help prevent vision loss. - A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. - All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. - If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40. - You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss. Updated by: Franklin W.

              "text": "Hair loss (Treatment): Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year. Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results. The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss. Medication If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months. Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are: - Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits. Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). - Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits. Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets. Surgery In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left. During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results. Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring. Wigs and hairpieces You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available. If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor."

              "text": "Overweight and Obesity (Treatment): Treatment for overweight and obesity depends on the cause and severity of your condition. Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. You may need treatments for any complications that you have. Healthy lifestyle changes To help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend that you adopt lifelong healthy lifestyle changes. Heart-healthy eating. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It\u2019s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Use the Body Weight Planner to find out your daily calorie needs and to set goals. Visit healthy recipes and plan for success. Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. Visit Chose My Plate or 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for more information. Physical activity. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Physical activity is an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Visit Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits for more information. Healthy Sleep. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Read Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency more information. Making lifelong healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and physical activity, can help you modify your energy balance to help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight. For example: To aim for a healthy weight, or lose weight, you want your energy OUT to be more than your energy IN. To maintain weight loss you want your energy IN and energy OUT to be the same.\u00a0 Behavioral weight-loss programs Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. Read Living With\u00a0for more information about required follow-up for these behavioral treatment programs. Read more Did you know your brain\u2019s pleasure and reward centers can be stimulated by food and the act of eating, making it harder to change eating patterns and lose weight? Researchers know that our brains can become patterned so that we feel pleasure or reward from eating. This can make us unconsciously crave food so our bodies feel that sense of pleasure. It can also make it hard to change our eating patterns, lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers are studying whether cognitive behavioral therapies can be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity by retraining the brain to not associate pleasure with food and the act of eating. Medicines When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. These medicines work in the following parts of your body. Brain. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Weight loss medicines are not recommended as a single treatment for weight loss. These medicines can help you lose weight but when combined with lifestyle changes may result in greater weight loss. Some of these medicines should not be used if you have certain conditions or are taking certain medicines. Also, these medicines have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breast feeding, or have a family history of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke. Surgical procedures Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. A small part of the stomach is connected to the middle part of the intestine, bypassing the first part of intestine. This decreases the amount of food that you can eat and the amount of fat your body can take in and store. Gastrectomy. A big portion of the stomach is removed to decrease the amount of food that you can eat. Gastric banding. A hollow band is placed around the upper part of the stomach creating a smaller stomach. This decreases the amount of food you can eat. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, internal rupture of sutures, or even death. Read gastric bypass surgery for more information. Read more Interested in learning why these surgeries lead to weight loss in some patients? First, these surgeries reduce the amount of food stored in the stomach and the amount of calories your body can take in. This can help your body restore energy balance. Second, these surgeries change the levels of certain hormones and the way the brain responds to these hormones to control hunger urges. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery. Look for Living With\u00a0will explain recommendations that your doctor may give, including lifelong healthy lifestyle changes and medical care to prevent your condition from recurring, getting worse, or causing complications. Research for Your Health\u00a0will explain how we are using current research and advancing research to treat people with overweight and obesity. Participate in NHLBI Clinical Trials\u00a0will discuss our ongoing clinical studies that are investigating treatments for overweight and obesity."

Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. You may need treatments for any complications that you have. Healthy lifestyle changes To help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend that you adopt lifelong healthy lifestyle changes. Heart-healthy eating. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It\u2019s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Use the Body Weight Planner to find out your daily calorie needs and to set goals. Visit healthy recipes and plan for success. Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. Visit Chose My Plate or 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for more information. Physical activity. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Physical activity is an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Visit Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits for more information. Healthy Sleep. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Read Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency more information. Making lifelong healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and physical activity, can help you modify your energy balance to help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight. For example: To aim for a healthy weight, or lose weight, you want your energy OUT to be more than your energy IN. To maintain weight loss you want your energy IN and energy OUT to be the same.\u00a0 Behavioral weight-loss programs Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. Read Living With\u00a0for more information about required follow-up for these behavioral treatment programs. Read more Did you know your brain\u2019s pleasure and reward centers can be stimulated by food and the act of eating, making it harder to change eating patterns and lose weight? Researchers know that our brains can become patterned so that we feel pleasure or reward from eating. This can make us unconsciously crave food so our bodies feel that sense of pleasure. It can also make it hard to change our eating patterns, lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers are studying whether cognitive behavioral therapies can be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity by retraining the brain to not associate pleasure with food and the act of eating. Medicines When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. These medicines work in the following parts of your body. Brain. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Weight loss medicines are not recommended as a single treatment for weight loss. These medicines can help you lose weight but when combined with lifestyle changes may result in greater weight loss. Some of these medicines should not be used if you have certain conditions or are taking certain medicines. Also, these medicines have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breast feeding, or have a family history of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke. Surgical procedures Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. A small part of the stomach is connected to the middle part of the intestine, bypassing the first part of intestine. This decreases the amount of food that you can eat and the amount of fat your body can take in and store. Gastrectomy. A big portion of the stomach is removed to decrease the amount of food that you can eat. Gastric banding. A hollow band is placed around the upper part of the stomach creating a smaller stomach. This decreases the amount of food you can eat. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, internal rupture of sutures, or even death. Read gastric bypass surgery for more information. Read more Interested in learning why these surgeries lead to weight loss in some patients? First, these surgeries reduce the amount of food stored in the stomach and the amount of calories your body can take in. This can help your body restore energy balance. Second, these surgeries change the levels of certain hormones and the way the brain responds to these hormones to control hunger urges. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery. Look for Living With\u00a0will explain recommendations that your doctor may give, including lifelong healthy lifestyle changes and medical care to prevent your condition from recurring, getting worse, or causing complications. Research for Your Health\u00a0will explain how we are using current research and advancing research to treat people with overweight and obesity. Participate in NHLBI Clinical Trials\u00a0will discuss our ongoing clinical studies that are investigating treatments for overweight and obesity.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The health tip fliers you've seen are a good start, but I can offer more detailed information on HIV/AIDS treatment.\n\n**Understanding HIV/AIDS Treatment:**\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) treatment, also known as antiretroviral therapy (ART), aims to slow the progression of the virus in the body. While there's no cure for HIV, effective treatment can help people with HIV live long, healthy lives.\n\n**Key Points About HIV/AIDS Treatment:**\n\n1. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** ART involves taking a combination of HIV medicines every day. The goal of ART is to suppress the viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood) to a very low level, which makes it harder for the virus to progress to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others.\n\n2. **Benefits of Treatment:** \n   - Helps to restore the immune system by increasing CD4 cell counts.\n   - Reduces the risk of AIDS-defining illnesses.\n   - Lowers the risk of transmitting HIV to others.\n   - Improves quality of life.\n\n3. **Types of ART Medications:** There are several classes of ART medications, including:\n   - Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)\n   - Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)\n   - Protease Inhibitors (PIs)\n   - Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs)\n   - Entry Inhibitors\n\n4. **The Importance of Adherence:** Taking ART as prescribed is crucial for its effectiveness. Missing doses can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug-resistant strains of the virus.\n\n5. **Regular Monitoring:** People with HIV should have regular check-ups with their healthcare provider to monitor their viral load and CD4 cell count. These metrics help guide treatment decisions.\n\n6. **Prevention of Oportunistic Infeccions:** Certain medications and vaccines can help prevent opportunistic infections in people with HIV.\n\n**Supporting HIV-Positive Transgender Women:**\n\nYour study focusing on helping HIV-positive transgender women into HIV quality care is crucial.

              "text": "Knock knees: Knock knees are condition in which the knees touch, but the ankles do not touch. The legs turn inward. Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart. By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position). Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as: - Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed) - Osteomyelitis (bone infection) - Overweight or obesity - Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D) A health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development. Knock knees are not treated in most cases. If the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace. This brace is attached to a shoe. Surgery may be considered for knock knees that are severe and continue beyond late childhood. Children normally outgrow knock knees without treatment, unless it is caused by a disease. If surgery is needed, the results are most often good. Complications may include: - Difficulty walking (very rare) - Self-esteem changes related to cosmetic appearance of knock knees - If left untreated, knock knees can lead to early arthritis of the knee Call your provider if you think your child has knock knees. There is no known prevention for normal knock knees. Updated by: Neil K. Kaneshiro, MD, MHA, Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

While it's a common condition, especially in children, it can persist into adulthood.\n\nAs a 23-year-old, you're considered an adult, and treatment options may vary. Before we dive into potential solutions, I have a few questions to help me better understand your situation:\n\n1. **How long have you had knock knees?** Was it a condition you had since childhood, or did it develop later in life?\n2. **How severe is your knock knee condition?** Are your knees mildly, moderately, or severely affected?\n3. **Do you experience any pain or discomfort?** Are there any specific activities that make your knees hurt or feel unstable?\n4. **Have you tried any treatments or exercises before?** Have you consulted a doctor or orthopedic specialist about your condition?\n\nAssuming you've not consulted a doctor before, here's a general overview of treatment options:\n\n**Conservative management:**\n\n1. **Physical therapy:** Strengthening the muscles around your knees, such as the quadriceps and hamstrings, can help improve knee alignment and stability. A physical therapist can create a customized exercise program for you.\n2. **Orthotics and shoe modifications:** Wearing shoes with good arch support and using orthotics, like knee supports or shoe inserts, can help redistribute pressure and alleviate stress on your knees.\n3. **Weight management:** Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the pressure on your knees.\n\n**Surgical options:**\n\n1. **Knee realignment surgery:** In some cases, surgery may be necessary to realign the knee joint. This is usually considered for severe cases or when conservative management hasn't been effective.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Consult an orthopedic specialist:** Schedule an appointment with an orthopedic doctor or a sports medicine specialist to discuss your condition and determine the best course of treatment.\n2. **Get an evaluation:** The doctor will assess your knee alignment, joint health, and overall condition to recommend a treatment plan.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and a professional evaluation is necessary to determine the best treatment for your specific case.\n\nHow do you want to proceed? Would you like me to help you find resources to schedule an appointment with an orthopedic specialist or provide more information on exercises and conservative management?",

The legs turn inward. Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart. By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position). Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as: - Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed) - Osteomyelitis (bone infection) - Overweight or obesity - Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D) A health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development. Knock knees are not treated in most cases. If the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace. This brace is attached to a shoe. Surgery may be considered for knock knees that are severe and continue beyond late childhood. Children normally outgrow knock knees without treatment, unless it is caused by a disease. If surgery is needed, the results are most often good. Complications may include: - Difficulty walking (very rare) - Self-esteem changes related to cosmetic appearance of knock knees - If left untreated, knock knees can lead to early arthritis of the knee Call your provider if you think your child has knock knees. There is no known prevention for normal knock knees. Updated by: Neil K. Kaneshiro, MD, MHA, Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

              "text": "Nose fracture: A nose fracture is a break in the bone or cartilage over the bridge, or in the sidewall or septum (structure that divides the nostrils) of the nose. A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face. Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck. Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse. For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms may include: - Blood coming from the nose - Bruising around the eyes - Difficulty breathing through the nose - Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down) - Pain - Swelling The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. If a nose injury happens: - Try to stay calm. - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat. - Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding. - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose. - To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). - DO NOT try to straighten a broken nose - DO NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury Get medical help right away if: - Bleeding will not stop - Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose - You suspect a blood clot in the septum - You suspect a neck or head injury - The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape - The person is having difficulty breathing Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, or\u00a0riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades.

              "text": "Anal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor."

I'd be happy to provide you with some information.\n\n**What is Kartagener's syndrome?**\n\nKartagener's syndrome, also known as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. Cilia are tiny hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a crucial role in moving mucus, debris, and other substances out of the airways, brain, and other organs. In Kartagener's syndrome, the cilia are either immobile or dysfunctional, leading to various respiratory, fertility, and other complications.\n\n**Fertility concerns**\n\nRegarding fertility, Kartagener's syndrome can affect both males and females.\n\n* **Males:** Approximately 50% of males with Kartagener's syndrome have situs inversus, a condition where the major organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. This can lead to an increased risk of infertility due to:\n\t+ Immotile or dyskinetic spermatozoa (sperm cells that are unable to move properly).\n\t+ Epididymal and vas deferens abnormalities.\n* **Females:** Women with Kartagener's syndrome may experience:\n\t+ Reduced fertility due to impaired ciliary function in the fallopian tubes, which can hinder ovum (egg) transport.\n\t+ Increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nHowever, with advances in assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), individuals with Kartagener's syndrome can still achieve pregnancy.\n\n**Other symptoms**\n\nIn addition to fertility concerns, Kartagener's syndrome can cause a range of other symptoms, including:\n\n* **Respiratory issues:** Recurrent respiratory infections, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchitis.\n* **Situs inversus:** As mentioned earlier, approximately 50% of individuals with Kartagener's syndrome have situs inversus, which can lead to gastrointestinal and other complications.\n* **Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) problems:** Hearing loss, middle ear problems, and nasal polyps.\n* **Neurological issues:** Some individuals may experience headaches, hydrocephalus (fluid accumulation in the brain), or other neurological symptoms.\n\n**Management and treatment**\n\nWhile there is no cure for Kartagener's syndrome, various treatments can help manage its symptoms:\n\n* **Respiratory care:** Pulmonary rehabilitation, antibiotics, and airway clearance techniques (e.g., chest physiotherapy) to manage respiratory infections and maintain lung function.\n* **Fertility treatment:** ART, such as IVF, to overcome fertility challenges.\n* **ENT care:** Regular ear, nose, and throat check-ups to monitor and manage related issues.\n\nIt's essential to work with a multidisciplinary healthcare team, including a primary care physician, pulmonologist, ENT specialist, and fertility expert, to manage the various aspects of Kartagener's syndrome.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help.",

(About fertility) and if possible other symptoms. Thank you.\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nKartagener's syndrome! That's a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple systems in the body. I'd be happy to provide you with some information.\n\n**What is Kartagener's syndrome?**\n\nKartagener's syndrome, also known as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. Cilia are tiny hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a crucial role in moving mucus, debris, and other substances out of the airways, brain, and other organs. In Kartagener's syndrome, the cilia are either immobile or dysfunctional, leading to various respiratory, fertility, and other complications.\n\n**Fertility concerns**\n\nRegarding fertility, Kartagener's syndrome can affect both males and females.\n\n* **Males:** Approximately 50% of males with Kartagener's syndrome have situs inversus, a condition where the major organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. This can lead to an increased risk of infertility due to:\n\t+ Immotile or dyskinetic spermatozoa (sperm cells that are unable to move properly).\n\t+ Epididymal and vas deferens abnormalities.\n* **Females:** Women with Kartagener's syndrome may experience:\n\t+ Reduced fertility due to impaired ciliary function in the fallopian tubes, which can hinder ovum (egg) transport.\n\t+ Increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nHowever, with advances in assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), individuals with Kartagener's syndrome can still achieve pregnancy.\n\n**Other symptoms**\n\nIn addition to fertility concerns, Kartagener's syndrome can cause a range of other symptoms, including:\n\n* **Respiratory issues:** Recurrent respiratory infections, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchitis.\n* **Situs inversus:** As mentioned earlier, approximately 50% of individuals with Kartagener's syndrome have situs inversus, which can lead to gastrointestinal and other complications.\n* **Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) problems:** Hearing loss, middle ear problems, and nasal polyps.\n* **Neurological issues:** Some individuals may experience headaches, hydrocephalus (fluid accumulation in the brain), or other neurological symptoms.\n\n**Management and treatment**\n\nWhile there is no cure for Kartagener's syndrome, various treatments can help manage its symptoms:\n\n* **Respiratory care:** Pulmonary rehabilitation, antibiotics, and airway clearance techniques (e.g., chest physiotherapy) to manage respiratory infections and maintain lung function.\n* **Fertility treatment:** ART, such as IVF, to overcome fertility challenges.\n* **ENT care:** Regular ear, nose, and throat check-ups to monitor and manage related issues.\n\nIt's essential to work with a multidisciplinary healthcare team, including a primary care physician, pulmonologist, ENT specialist, and fertility expert, to manage the various aspects of Kartagener's syndrome.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nKartagener syndrome (Symptoms): Kartagener syndrome is characterized by p and situs inversus totalis. In people affected by situs inversus totalis, the internal organs including the heart, liver, spleen and intestine are on the opposite side of the body.

              "text": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis (Description): SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells."

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delusions - Dementia - Fluctuations in consciousness - Parkinsonism - Visual hallucinations - The exact underlying cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood. The symptoms of the condition are thought to occur when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the regions of the brain involved in thinking, memory and movement. The build-up of these clumps (which are called \"Lewy bodies\") appears to be associated with a loss of certain neurons (nerve cells ) in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters (chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells). The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, sleep, and mood. [4] Although Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically, more than one family member can rarely be affected. Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. For example, copy number variants or changes ( mutations ) in the SNCA gene have been reported in a few affected families. [5] [6] The APOE \u03b54 allele and mutations in the GBA gene have been associated with an increased risk of Lewy body dementia and the APOE \u03b52 allele with a decreased risk. [5] [7] [2] Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited . The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. [4] Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases\u00a0do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). [6] [5] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person\u2019s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis.

Persons with Tay-Sachs also have \"cherry-red\" spots in their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0A much rarer form of the disorder, called late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration. The incidence of Tay-Sachs has been particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent., as well as in certain French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns. Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease. Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired. \u00a0A very severe form of Tay-Sachs disease is know as Sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube. Even with the best of care, children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4, from recurring infection."

Persons with Tay-Sachs also have \"cherry-red\" spots in their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0A much rarer form of the disorder, called late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration. The incidence of Tay-Sachs has been particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent., as well as in certain French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns. Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease. Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired. \u00a0A very severe form of Tay-Sachs disease is know as Sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube. Even with the best of care, children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4, from recurring infection.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system. Additional signs and symptoms include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Children with Menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. Early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood. Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa) is a less severe form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints."

Thx\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nI'm so sorry to hear that your daughter has been diagnosed with Menkes disease. It's a rare genetic disorder that affects copper levels in the body, leading to a range of serious health issues.\n\nFirstly, please know that I'm here to provide general information and support. However, I want to emphasize that it's essential to consult with your daughter's healthcare team, including her pediatrician, geneticist, or other specialists, for personalized guidance and care.\n\nThat being said, here are some general steps you can take to manage Menkes disease:\n\n1. **Regular medical check-ups**: Ensure your daughter has regular appointments with her healthcare team to monitor her condition, address any concerns, and adjust treatment plans as needed.\n2. **Copper supplementation**: Menkes disease is characterized by low copper levels. Her healthcare team may recommend copper injections or supplements to help manage the condition.\n3. **Nutritional support**: A balanced diet rich in nutrients, including copper, is crucial. You may want to consult with a registered dietitian or a nutritionist to develop a personalized meal plan.\n4. **Monitoring for complications**: Menkes disease can lead to various complications, such as growth delays, developmental delays, and increased risk of infections. Regular monitoring and prompt treatment of any issues that arise can help mitigate these risks.\n5. **Genetic counseling**: As Menkes disease is a genetic disorder, you may want to consider genetic counseling to understand the condition, its inheritance pattern, and any reproductive implications.\n6. **Support networks**: Connecting with other families affected by Menkes disease can be incredibly helpful. You can search for support groups, online forums, or organizations that provide resources and community for families with rare genetic disorders.\n7. **Stay informed**: Stay up-to-date with the latest research and developments in Menkes disease management. This can help you make informed decisions about your daughter's care and potentially identify new treatment options.\n\nRemember, every individual with Menkes disease is unique, and the specific management plan will depend on your daughter's specific needs and circumstances.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide more information and guidance.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat is Menkes syndrome?: Menkes syndrome is a disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system. Additional signs and symptoms include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Children with Menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. Early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood. Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa) is a less severe form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Milroy disease, also known as primary lymphedema, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the lymphatic system, causing chronic swelling (edema) in one or more extremities. It's great that you're seeking help and guidance. I'll provide you with some information and suggestions, but please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\n**Understanding Milroy Disease:**\n\nMilroy disease is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth, but symptoms may not be apparent until later in life, often during puberty or in this case, early childhood. The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in removing excess fluids, proteins, and other substances from the body. In Milroy disease, the lymphatic vessels are abnormal, leading to impaired lymphatic drainage, which causes swelling.\n\n**Symptoms and progression:**\n\nThe swelling associated with Milroy disease can be progressive, as you've observed in your daughter. The swelling can be:\n\n* Unilateral (one-sided) or bilateral (as in your daughter's case, both legs and one hand)\n* Intermittent or constant\n* Worsening over time, as the lymphatic system becomes more impaired\n\n**Treatment and management:**\n\nWhile there is no cure for Milroy disease, various treatments can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications:\n\n1. **Compression garments:** Custom-fitted compression stockings or sleeves can help reduce swelling. These garments can be worn on a daily basis to help manage swelling.\n2. **Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD):** A gentle, specialized massage technique that helps stimulate lymphatic drainage and reduce swelling. A trained therapist can teach you and your daughter how to perform MLD.\n3. **Complete decongestive therapy (CDT):** A combination of MLD, compression bandaging, and exercises to help manage swelling.\n4. **Elevation:** Elevate the affected limbs above the level of the heart to reduce swelling.\n5. **Skin care:** Keep the skin clean and moisturized to prevent infections and skin problems.\n6. **Pain management:** Pain relief medication may be prescribed to manage discomfort associated with swelling.\n7. **Surgical interventions:** In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove excess skin and tissue or to improve lymphatic drainage.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\nConsult a:\n\n1. **Pediatrician:** Discuss your daughter's condition with her pediatrician to ensure they are aware of the progression and any concerns you have.\n2. **Lymphedema specialist:** A lymphedema specialist, such as a physical therapist or occupational therapist with expertise in lymphedema management, can assess your daughter's condition and develop a treatment plan.\n3. **Geneticist:** A geneticist can provide guidance on the genetic aspects of Milroy disease and discuss potential family planning implications.\n\n**Additional resources:**\n\n* National Lymphedema Network (NLN): A non-profit organization providing education, support, and resources for individuals with lymphedema and their families.\n* Mayo Clinic: Milroy disease ( provides information on symptoms, causes, and treatment options)",

Management is typically conservative and usually successful in most people. [3] Management of lymphedema should be guided by a lymphedema therapist. Some improvement is usually possible with the use of properly fitted compression hosiery or bandaging and well fitting, supportive shoes. Good skin care is essential. These measures may improve the cosmetic appearance of the affected areas, decrease their size, and reduce the risk of complications. [2] Decongestive physiotherapy , which combines compression bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage (a specialized massage technique), exercise, breathing exercises, dietary measures and skin care, has become the standard of care for primary lymphedema. [3] People with recurrent cellulitis may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics . [2] [3] Surgical intervention is considered a last option when other medical management fails. [3] When possible, people with Milroy disease should avoid: wounds to swollen areas (because of their reduced resistance to infection) long periods of immobility prolonged standing elevation of the affected limb certain medications (particularly calcium channel-blocking drugs that can cause increased leg swelling in some people)[2] Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

People with this condition have particularly short forearms and lower legs and a narrow chest with short ribs. Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is also characterized by the presence of extra fingers and toes (polydactyly), malformed fingernails and toenails, and dental abnormalities. More than half of affected individuals are born with a heart defect, which can cause serious or life-threatening health problems. The features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome overlap with those of another, milder condition called Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Like Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, Weyers acrofacial dysostosis involves tooth and nail abnormalities, although affected individuals have less pronounced short stature and typically do not have heart defects. The two conditions are caused by mutations in the same genes."

It is characterized by short stature, polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), ectodermal dysplasia, and various other physical and developmental anomalies.\n\nRegarding reproductive issues in individuals with EVC, research suggests that:\n\n1. **Reproductive capabilities:** Most individuals with EVC have normal reproductive organs and can have children. However, there may be an increased risk of reproductive complications, such as delayed puberty, infertility, or an increased risk of miscarriage.\n2. **Genetic counseling:** EVC is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a child needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. If both parents are carriers of the mutated gene, there is a 25% chance that each child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene and express EVC. Genetic counseling can help families understand the risks and make informed decisions about family planning.\n3. **Pregnancy and childbirth:** Women with EVC may face increased risks during pregnancy and childbirth due to their short stature and potential spinal deformities. Regular prenatal care and close monitoring by a healthcare provider are essential to ensure a healthy pregnancy and delivery.\n\nResearch on EVC has focused on:\n\n1. **Genetic studies:** Researchers have identified mutations in the EVC1 and EVC2 genes as the primary causes of EVC. These genes play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of cartilage, bone, and other tissues.\n2. **Clinical studies:** Studies have described the clinical features and natural history of EVC, including the spectrum of physical and developmental anomalies associated with the condition.\n3. **Therapeutic approaches:** Researchers are exploring potential therapeutic strategies to address the various complications associated with EVC, such as growth hormone therapy for short stature and orthopedic interventions for skeletal deformities.\n\nSome notable research studies and resources include:\n\n1. **The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD):** Provides information on EVC, including its symptoms, causes, and treatment options.\n2. **The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database:** Offers a comprehensive overview of EVC, including its genetic and clinical features.\n3. **The Ellis-van Creveld Syndrome Association:** A patient advocacy organization that provides support, resources, and information on EVC.\n\nRegarding your personal situation, if you have EVC and are concerned about having children, it is essential to:\n\n1. **Consult a genetic counselor:** A genetic counselor can help you understand the risks associated with passing EVC to your offspring and discuss family planning options.\n2. **Speak with a healthcare provider:** Your healthcare provider can assess your overall health and provide guidance on reproductive health and any potential complications.\n3. **Seek support:** Connecting with other individuals with EVC or joining a support group can provide valuable emotional support and help you navigate your reproductive choices.\n\nKeep in mind that every individual with EVC is unique, and the severity of symptoms can vary widely. By seeking guidance from healthcare professionals and staying informed about the latest research, you can make informed decisions about your reproductive health.",

By seeking guidance from healthcare professionals and staying informed about the latest research, you can make informed decisions about your reproductive health.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nEllis-van Creveld syndrome (Description): Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is an inherited disorder of bone growth that results in very short stature (dwarfism). People with this condition have particularly short forearms and lower legs and a narrow chest with short ribs. Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is also characterized by the presence of extra fingers and toes (polydactyly), malformed fingernails and toenails, and dental abnormalities. More than half of affected individuals are born with a heart defect, which can cause serious or life-threatening health problems. The features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome overlap with those of another, milder condition called Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Like Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, Weyers acrofacial dysostosis involves tooth and nail abnormalities, although affected individuals have less pronounced short stature and typically do not have heart defects. The two conditions are caused by mutations in the same genes.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness: Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments. Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

And how severe would you say symptoms may get.\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nOleander (Nerium oleander) is a highly toxic plant, and ingesting even small amounts can cause severe symptoms. If someone ingested oleander toxins by touching the plant's inner stem and then eating without washing their hands, the symptoms could start within 30 minutes to 6 hours after ingestion. However, the exact timing can vary depending on the amount of toxin ingested, the individual's weight, and their sensitivity to the toxin.\n\nThe severity of symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening. Oleander contains toxic compounds called cardiac glycosides, which can affect the heart, nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract.\n\nMild to moderate symptoms may include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Abdominal pain\n* Diarrhea\n* Headache\n* Dizziness\n* Fatigue\n\nSevere symptoms may include:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n* Slow or fast heart rate\n* Low blood pressure\n* Muscle weakness\n* Seizures\n* Coma\n\nIn severe cases, oleander ingestion can be fatal, especially if left untreated. If you suspect someone has ingested oleander, it is essential to seek medical attention immediately.\n\nIn this scenario, since the person only touched the plant and then ate without washing their hands, the amount of toxin ingested might be relatively small. However, it's still crucial to exercise caution and seek medical attention if symptoms develop.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been exposed to oleander, please contact a healthcare professional, a poison control center (1-800-222-1222 in the United States), or emergency services for guidance.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nOleander poisoning: Oleander poisoning occurs when someone eats the flowers or chews the leaves or stems of the oleander plant\u00a0(Nerium oleander), or its relative, the yellow oleander (Cascabela thevetia). This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous ingredients include: - Digitoxigenin - Neriin - Oleandrin - Oleondroside Note: This list may not include all poisonous ingredients. The poisonous substances are found in all parts of the oleander plant: - Flowers - Leaves - Stems - Twigs Oleander poisoning can affect many parts of the body. HEART AND BLOOD - Irregular or slow heartbeat - Low blood pressure - Weakness EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROAT - Blurred vision - Vision disturbances, including halos STOMACH AND INTESTINES - Diarrhea - Loss of appetite - Nausea and vomiting - Stomach pain NERVOUS SYSTEM - Confusion - Death - Depression - Disorientation - Dizziness - Drowsiness - Fainting - Headache - Lethargy SKIN - Hives - Rash Note: Depression, loss of appetite, and halos are most often seen in chronic overdose cases. Seek immediate medical help. DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider. Get the following information: - Person's age, weight, and condition - Name and part of the plant swallowed, if known - Time it was swallowed - Amount swallowed Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does not need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive: - Activated charcoal - Blood and urine tests - Breathing support - Chest x-ray - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) - Fluids through a vein (IV) - Medicines to treat symptoms including an antidote to reverse the effects of the poison - Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage) How well you do depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster you get medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Symptoms last for 1 to 3 days and may require a hospital stay. Death is unlikely. DO NOT touch or eat any plant with which you are not familiar. Wash your hands after working in the garden or walking in the woods.

The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma. Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include: - Brain tumor - Cranial arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis) - Multiple sclerosis - Stroke There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults. Optic nerve atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded. Over time, the pupil will be less able to react to light, and eventually,\u00a0its ability to react to light may be lost. The health care provider will do a complete eye exam to look for the condition. The exam will include tests of: - Color vision - Pupil light reflex - Tonometry - Visual acuity You may also need a complete physical exam and other tests. Damage from optic nerve atrophy cannot be reversed. The underlying disease must be found and treated. Otherwise, vision loss will continue. Rarely, conditions that lead to optic atrophy may be treatable. Vision lost to optic nerve atrophy cannot be recovered. It is very important to protect the other eye. People with this condition need to be checked regularly by an eye doctor with experience in nerve-related conditions. Tell your doctor right away about any change in vision. Many causes of optic nerve atrophy cannot be prevented. Prevention steps include: - Older adults should have their provider carefully manage their blood pressure. - Use standard safety precautions to prevent injuries to the face. Most facial injuries are the result of car accidents. Wearing seat belts may help prevent these injuries. - Schedule a routine annual eye exam to check for glaucoma. - Never drink home-brewed alcohol and forms of alcohol that are not intended for drinking. Methanol, which is found in home-brewed alcohol, can cause optic nerve atrophy in both eyes. Updated by: Franklin W. Lusby, MD, ophthalmologist, Lusby Vision Institute, La Jolla, CA.

              "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin - Eyes - Lungs - Heart - Kidneys - Salivary glands - Nerve tissue - Bone marrow - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium - the lining of the membranes that surround your joints. The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch. Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment. Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors - such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria - that may trigger the disease. Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include: - Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis. - Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60. - Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Blood tests People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. Imaging tests Your doctor may recommend X-rays to help track the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in your joints over time. MRI and ultrasound tests can help your doctor judge the severity of the disease in your body. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But recent discoveries indicate that remission of symptoms is more likely when treatment begins early with strong medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Medications The types of medications recommended by your doctor will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how long you've had rheumatoid arthritis. - NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects may include ringing in your ears, stomach irritation, heart problems, and liver and kidney damage. - Steroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes. Doctors often prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve acute symptoms, with the goal of gradually tapering off the medication. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. Common DMARDs include methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo), leflunomide (Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects vary but may include liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infections. - Biologic agents. Also known as biologic response modifiers, this newer class of DMARDs includes abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan), tocilizumab (Actemra) and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). These drugs can target parts of the immune system that trigger inflammation that causes joint and tissue damage. These types of drugs also increase the risk of infections. Biologic DMARDs are usually most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD, such as methotrexate. Therapy Your doctor may send you to a physical or occupational therapist who can teach you exercises to help keep your joints flexible. The therapist may also suggest new ways to do daily tasks, which will be easier on your joints. For example, if your fingers are sore, you may want to pick up an object using your forearms. Assistive devices can make it easier to avoid stressing your painful joints. For instance, a kitchen knife equipped with a saw handle helps protect your finger and wrist joints. Certain tools, such as buttonhooks, can make it easier to get dressed. Catalogs and medical supply stores are good places to look for ideas. Surgery If medications fail to prevent or slow joint damage, you and your doctor may consider surgery to repair damaged joints. Surgery may help restore your ability to use your joint. It can also reduce pain and correct deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis surgery may involve one or more of the following procedures: - Synovectomy. Surgery to remove the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint). Synovectomy can be performed on knees, elbows, wrists, fingers and hips. - Tendon repair. Inflammation and joint damage may cause tendons around your joint to loosen or rupture. Your surgeon may be able to repair the tendons around your joint. - Joint fusion. Surgically fusing a joint may be recommended to stabilize or realign a joint and for pain relief when a joint replacement isn't an option. - Total joint replacement. During joint replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the damaged parts of your joint and inserts a prosthesis made of metal and plastic. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding, infection and pain. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. You can take steps to care for your body if you have rheumatoid arthritis. These self-care measures, when used along with your rheumatoid arthritis medications, can help you manage your signs and symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, and it can help fight fatigue you might feel. Check with your doctor before you start exercising. If you're just getting started, begin by taking a walk. Try swimming or gentle water aerobics. Avoid exercising tender, injured or severely inflamed joints. - Apply heat or cold. Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull the sensation of pain. Cold also has a numbing effect and decreases muscle spasms. - Relax. Find ways to cope with pain by reducing stress in your life. Techniques such as guided imagery, distraction and muscle relaxation can all be used to control pain. Some common complementary and alternative treatments that have shown promise for rheumatoid arthritis include: - Fish oil. Some preliminary studies have found that fish oil supplements may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain and stiffness. Side effects can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. Fish oil can interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Plant oils. The seeds of evening primrose, borage and black currant contain a type of fatty acid that may help with rheumatoid arthritis pain and morning stiffness. Side effects may include nausea, diarrhea and gas. Some plant oils can cause liver damage or interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Tai chi. This movement therapy involves gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use tai chi to relieve stress in their lives. Small studies have found that tai chi may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, tai chi is safe. But don't do any moves that cause pain."

Specifically, the surface of the brain develops too many folds which are unusually small. The signs and symptoms associated with the condition vary based on how much of the brain and which areas of the brain are affected; however, affected people may experience recurrent seizures ( epilepsy ); delayed development; crossed eyes ; problems with speech and swallowing; and muscle weakness or paralysis. Bilateral forms (affecting both sides of the brain) tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Polymicrogyria can result from both genetic and environmental causes. It may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome . Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] A wide variety of symptoms may be observed in people with polymicrogyria, depending on the areas of the brain implicated and whether or not it is part of a larger syndrome . Signs and symptoms may include: [3] [4] Developmental delay Crossed eyes Epilepsy Paralysis of the face, throat, and tongue Difficulty with speech and swallowing Drooling The diagnosis of polymicrogyria is made by imaging brain structures using\u00a0 MRI . Typical findings include areas of the\u00a0 cerebral cortex\u00a0with a complex set of small gyri that appear fused to each other and separated by shallow sulci. These findings may be isolated to one side of the brain (unilateral) or may involve both sides of the brain (bilateral). [3] [4] The resources below provide information about treatment options for this condition. If you have questions about which treatment is right for you, talk to your healthcare professional.

While it's difficult to predict the exact course of your child's development, I can provide some general information that might be helpful.\n\n**Current development and progress**\n\nAt 16 months, it's not uncommon for children with PMG to experience delays in gross motor skills, such as sitting up or crawling. However, it's great to hear that your child is trying and improving in grabbing things, which indicates some progress in their fine motor skills.\n\n**Potential for brain growth and development**\n\nResearch suggests that, in some cases, the brain can reorganize and compensate for damaged or abnormal areas, a process known as neuroplasticity. However, the extent to which this can occur in PMG is still not well understood.\n\nWhile it's possible for children with PMG to make significant progress, it's unlikely that their brain will \"grow out\" of the condition or become completely normal.

My 16 month old son has this. Does not sit up our crawl yet but still trying and is improving in grabbing things etc etc. Have read about other cases that seem 10000 time worse. It's it possible for this post of his brain to grown to normal and he grow out of it?\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nI'm glad you're seeking information and support for your child's condition.\n\nPolymicrogyria (PMG) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by an abnormal brain development, specifically an excessive number of small folds on the surface of the brain. The impact of PMG on cognitive, motor, and language development can vary widely, depending on the location and extent of the brain abnormalities.\n\nEvery child with PMG is unique, and their development and outcomes can differ significantly. While it's difficult to predict the exact course of your child's development, I can provide some general information that might be helpful.\n\n**Current development and progress**\n\nAt 16 months, it's not uncommon for children with PMG to experience delays in gross motor skills, such as sitting up or crawling. However, it's great to hear that your child is trying and improving in grabbing things, which indicates some progress in their fine motor skills.\n\n**Potential for brain growth and development**\n\nResearch suggests that, in some cases, the brain can reorganize and compensate for damaged or abnormal areas, a process known as neuroplasticity. However, the extent to which this can occur in PMG is still not well understood.\n\nWhile it's possible for children with PMG to make significant progress, it's unlikely that their brain will \"grow out\" of the condition or become completely normal. The brain abnormalities associated with PMG are typically present from birth and are not likely to resolve on their own.\n\n**Outcomes and long-term expectations**\n\nThe outcomes for children with PMG vary widely, depending on the severity of the condition, the location of the brain abnormalities, and individual differences in brain development. Some children with PMG may:\n\n1. Make significant progress in their development, with some achieving near-normal cognitive and motor skills.\n2. Experience moderate delays and require ongoing support and therapy to manage their development.\n3. Have more significant challenges, requiring lifelong support and care.\n\nIt's essential to focus on your child's individual strengths and needs, rather than comparing them to others with PMG. Celebrate small victories and milestones, and work closely with your child's healthcare team to develop a personalized plan for their care and support.\n\n**Ongoing support and therapy**\n\nTo help your child make the most progress, consider the following:\n\n1. Regular therapy sessions: Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help your child develop motor, cognitive, and communication skills.\n2. Developmental monitoring: Regular check-ups with your child's healthcare team will help track their progress and identify any areas that require additional support.\n3. Family support: Connect with other families affected by PMG through support groups or online forums to share experiences and gain valuable insights.\n\nKeep in mind that every child with PMG is unique, and their journey will be shaped by their individual strengths, challenges, and needs. While it's uncertain what the future holds, with ongoing support, therapy, and care, your child can make progress and reach their full potential.\n\nPlease consult with your child's healthcare team for personalized guidance and support. They can provide more specific information about your child's condition and help you develop a plan to address their unique needs.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nPolymicrogyria: Polymicrogyria is a condition characterized by abnormal development of the brain before birth. Specifically, the surface of the brain develops too many folds which are unusually small. The signs and symptoms associated with the condition vary based on how much of the brain and which areas of the brain are affected; however, affected people may experience recurrent seizures ( epilepsy ); delayed development; crossed eyes ; problems with speech and swallowing; and muscle weakness or paralysis. Bilateral forms (affecting both sides of the brain) tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Polymicrogyria can result from both genetic and environmental causes. It may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome . Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] A wide variety of symptoms may be observed in people with polymicrogyria, depending on the areas of the brain implicated and whether or not it is part of a larger syndrome . Signs and symptoms may include: [3] [4] Developmental delay Crossed eyes Epilepsy Paralysis of the face, throat, and tongue Difficulty with speech and swallowing Drooling The diagnosis of polymicrogyria is made by imaging brain structures using\u00a0 MRI . Typical findings include areas of the\u00a0 cerebral cortex\u00a0with a complex set of small gyri that appear fused to each other and separated by shallow sulci. These findings may be isolated to one side of the brain (unilateral) or may involve both sides of the brain (bilateral). [3] [4] The resources below provide information about treatment options for this condition. If you have questions about which treatment is right for you, talk to your healthcare professional.

              "text": "Leukemia (Treatment): Treatment for your leukemia depends on many factors. Your doctor determines your leukemia treatment options based on your age and overall health, the type of leukemia you have, and whether it has spread to other parts of your body, including the central nervous system. Common treatments used to fight leukemia include: - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells. Depending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein. - Biological therapy. Biological therapy works by using treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack leukemia cells. - Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific vulnerabilities within your cancer cells. For example, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) stops the action of a protein within the leukemia cells of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. This can help control the disease. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body. You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a stem cell transplant. - Stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. Before a stem cell transplant, you receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help to rebuild your bone marrow. You may receive stem cells from a donor, or in some cases you may be able to use your own stem cells. A stem cell transplant is very similar to a bone marrow transplant."

            "text": "I'd be happy to help you with your school project about leukemia. Here are the answers to your questions:\n\n1. **What causes leukemia cancer?**\nLeukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. The exact cause of leukemia is not known, but it's believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some risk factors that may contribute to the development of leukemia include exposure to radiation, certain chemicals, and viruses, as well as genetic mutations.\n\n2. **Can you survive leukemia?**\nYes, many people with leukemia can survive and even go into remission, which means that the cancer is no longer detectable in the body. The survival rate for leukemia depends on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the individual's overall health. With modern treatments, the five-year survival rate for leukemia is around 65%.\n\n3. **How does leukemia affect your body?**\nLeukemia affects the body by causing an abnormal increase in white blood cells, which can lead to anemia, bleeding and bruising, and infections. Leukemia can also cause fatigue, weight loss, and weakness. If left untreated, leukemia can lead to serious complications, such as organ damage and failure.\n\n4. **Is leukemia inherited?**\nSome types of leukemia have a genetic component, which means that they can be inherited. However, most cases of leukemia are not inherited and occur spontaneously. Certain genetic syndromes, such as Down syndrome, can increase the risk of developing leukemia.\n\n5. **What is advanced leukemia?**\nAdvanced leukemia refers to leukemia that has progressed to a more advanced stage, such as acute leukemia or refractory leukemia. At this stage, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, or spleen. Advanced leukemia requires more aggressive treatment.\n\n6. **How long can someone with leukemia expect to live?**\nThe life expectancy for someone with leukemia depends on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the individual's overall health. With modern treatments, many people with leukemia can live for five years or more after diagnosis. However, the survival rate varies depending on the specific type of leukemia.\n\n7. **Can you tell if you have leukemia?**\nIn some cases, leukemia can be asymptomatic, which means that there are no noticeable symptoms. However, common symptoms of leukemia include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, frequent infections, and easy bruising or bleeding. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's essential to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis.\n\n8. **What treatments do you need to take?**\nTreatment for leukemia depends on the type and stage of the disease. Common treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Some people may also require supportive care, such as blood transfusions and antibiotics, to manage symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n9. **What are the signs of leukemia?**\nThe signs and symptoms of leukemia can include:\n\t* Fatigue and weakness\n\t* Pale skin\n\t* Frequent infections\n\t* Easy bruising or bleeding\n\t* Swollen lymph nodes, liver, or spleen\n\t* Bone pain or tenderness\n\t* Weight loss\n\t* Night sweats\n\n10. **What is the difference between AML and CML?**\nAML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) and CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) are two types of leukemia that affect the myeloid cells in the bone marrow.\n\t* AML is an aggressive and fast-growing cancer that requires immediate treatment. It's the most common type of leukemia in adults.\n\t* CML is a slower-growing cancer that progresses more slowly than AML. It's often diagnosed in the chronic phase, which can last for years. However, if left untreated, CML can progress to an accelerated phase or blast crisis, which is similar to AML.\n\nI hope this information helps you with your school project about leukemia!",

              "text": "Psoriasis (Treatment): The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection. Three treatment options are available: - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments. - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments. - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis. TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL) Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include: - Cortisone creams and ointments - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid) - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) - Moisturizers - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used. Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: - Adalimumab (Humira) - Etanercept (Enbrel) - Infliximab (Remicade) - Ustekinumab (Stelara) - Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - Apremilast (Otezla) - Ixekizumab (Taltz) PHOTOTHERAPY Some people may choose to have phototherapy: - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light. - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light. OTHER TREATMENTS If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. HOME CARE Following these tips at home may help: - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (240 mL) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water. - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned. - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood. - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse."

Three treatment options are available: - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments. - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments. - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis. TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL) Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include: - Cortisone creams and ointments - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid) - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) - Moisturizers - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used. Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: - Adalimumab (Humira) - Etanercept (Enbrel) - Infliximab (Remicade) - Ustekinumab (Stelara) - Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - Apremilast (Otezla) - Ixekizumab (Taltz) PHOTOTHERAPY Some people may choose to have phototherapy: - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light. - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light. OTHER TREATMENTS If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. HOME CARE Following these tips at home may help: - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (240 mL) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water. - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned. - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood. - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. One of the most promising MS research areas involves naturally occurring antiviral proteins known as interferons. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe. In addition, there are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models. In 2001, the National Academies/Institute of Medicine, a Federal technical and scientific advisory agency, prepared a strategic review of MS research.

The quest for a cure for MS is an active area of research, and while it's challenging to predict exactly when a cure will be found, I'll provide you with some insights and a general outline of the progress being made.\n\n**Current understanding of MS:**\nMultiple Sclerosis is a chronic, autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering (myelin) of nerve fibers, disrupting communication between nerve cells. This leads to a wide range of symptoms, including vision problems, muscle weakness, balance issues, and cognitive difficulties.\n\n**Research progress:**\nOver the past few decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of MS and developing treatments. While there is no single \"cure\" yet, various disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been approved to slow disease progression, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life for people with MS.\n\n**Is a cure possible?**\nWhile it's difficult to predict exactly when a cure will be found, researchers are actively exploring several promising areas:\n\n1. **Stem cell therapies:** Researchers are investigating the use of stem cells to repair damaged myelin and promote neural regeneration.\n2. **Gene therapies:** Scientists are working on gene therapies that aim to modify or replace faulty genes contributing to MS.\n3. **Immunomodulatory therapies:** Researchers are developing new treatments that target specific immune cells or molecules involved in the disease process.\n4. **Personalized medicine:** Advances in precision medicine are helping researchers develop tailored treatments based on individual genetic profiles and disease characteristics.\n\n**Time frame for a cure:**\nIt's challenging to provide a specific time frame for a cure, as research progress can be unpredictable. However, here are some general estimates based on current trends:\n\n* **Short-term (5-10 years):** Expect significant improvements in disease management and symptom treatment, with more effective and targeted therapies becoming available.\n* **Mid-term (10-20 years):** A better understanding of the underlying causes of MS and the development of more effective treatments, potentially including regenerative therapies, may lead to more substantial disease control and improved quality of life.\n* **Long-term (20-50 years):** A cure or a treatment that can halt or reverse disease progression is possible, but this will likely require continued advances in fields like gene editing, stem cell therapies, and precision medicine.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates are rough and based on current research momentum. A cure for MS may be discovered sooner or later than predicted.\n\n**Resources for your research assignment:**\n\n* National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS): A great resource for information on MS research, treatment, and clinical trials.\n* Multiple Sclerosis Research Foundation (MSRF): Provides updates on the latest research developments and funding initiatives.\n* The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF) and other organizations also support research into MS and related neurological disorders.\n\nI hope this information helps you with your research assignment.

However, here are some general estimates based on current trends:\n\n* **Short-term (5-10 years):** Expect significant improvements in disease management and symptom treatment, with more effective and targeted therapies becoming available.\n* **Mid-term (10-20 years):** A better understanding of the underlying causes of MS and the development of more effective treatments, potentially including regenerative therapies, may lead to more substantial disease control and improved quality of life.\n* **Long-term (20-50 years):** A cure or a treatment that can halt or reverse disease progression is possible, but this will likely require continued advances in fields like gene editing, stem cell therapies, and precision medicine.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates are rough and based on current research momentum. A cure for MS may be discovered sooner or later than predicted.\n\n**Resources for your research assignment:**\n\n* National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS): A great resource for information on MS research, treatment, and clinical trials.\n* Multiple Sclerosis Research Foundation (MSRF): Provides updates on the latest research developments and funding initiatives.\n* The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF) and other organizations also support research into MS and related neurological disorders.\n\nI hope this information helps you with your research assignment. Good luck with your project!\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nwhat research (or clinical trials) is being done for Multiple Sclerosis?: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. One of the most promising MS research areas involves naturally occurring antiviral proteins known as interferons. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe. In addition, there are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models. In 2001, the National Academies/Institute of Medicine, a Federal technical and scientific advisory agency, prepared a strategic review of MS research.

              "text": "Prostate cancer - treatment: Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment. Sometimes your doctor may recommend 1 treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be 2 or more treatments that could be good for you. Factors you and your doctor must think about include: - Your age and other medical problems you may have - Side effects that occur with each type of treatment - How much the prostate cancer has spread - Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread - Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result Ask your doctor to explain these things following about your treatment choices: - Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread? - How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure. Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone. External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland: - Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated. - Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless. - Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital. - Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. Side effects may include: - Appetite loss - Diarrhea - Erection problems - Fatigue - Rectal burning or injury - Skin reactions - Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well. Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland. - A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them. - The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include: - Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum - Red-brown urine or semen - Impotence - Incontinence - Urinary retention - Diarrhea Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer. The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist: - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months. - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug: - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone. - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body's immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

This technique is also known as internal radiation therapy.\n\nWhen aimed at malignant tumors, brachytherapy can be a safe and effective decision for treating prostate cancer, but like any medical treatment, it's not without risks and considerations. Here are some points to consider:\n\n### Safety and Efficacy\n\n- **Localized Treatment**: Brachytherapy is a localized treatment, meaning the radiation is focused on the tumor site, which can reduce damage to surrounding healthy tissues.\n- **Effective for Early-Stage Cancer**: It's particularly effective for men with early-stage prostate cancer that hasn't spread beyond the prostate.\n- **Low Risk of Distant Side Effects**: Because the radiation is concentrated in a small area, the risk of side effects in distant parts of the body is lower compared to external beam radiation therapy.\n\n### Potential Risks and Side Effects\n\n- **Urinary Symptoms**: Men may experience urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, or burning during urination. These symptoms are usually temporary but can persist in some cases.\n- **Sexual Dysfunction**: Erectile dysfunction is a potential side effect, although the risk varies depending on factors like age and pre-existing sexual function.\n- **Rectal Symptoms**: Some men may experience rectal discomfort, urgency, or diarrhea.\n- **Radiation Exposure to Others**: Since the radioactive seeds emit low-level radiation, there might be temporary restrictions on close contact with pregnant women or young children.\n\n### Considerations for Safety\n\n- **Choosing a Qualified Doctor**: It's crucial to have a skilled and experienced doctor perform the procedure to minimize risks.\n- **Discussion of Side Effects**: A thorough discussion with your doctor about potential side effects and how they can be managed is essential.\n- **Follow-Up Care**: Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor for any complications and assess the treatment's effectiveness.\n\n### Who is a Good Candidate?\n\nBrachytherapy is not suitable for all men with prostate cancer. Factors that might make brachytherapy a good option include:\n\n- Having a low to intermediate risk of prostate cancer\n- Having a prostate gland that is not too large\n- Not having significant urinary symptoms\n- Being in overall good health\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor many men, brachytherapy can be a safe and effective treatment option for prostate cancer, offering a high chance of cure with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. However, the decision to undergo brachytherapy should be made after thorough consultation with a healthcare provider, considering the individual's specific health situation, the stage and aggressiveness of the cancer, and potential side effects.",

              "text": "Spina bifida (Treatment): Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn't require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do. Surgery before birth Nerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if it's not treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, and potential benefits for you and your baby. It's important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist. Cesarean birth Many babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby. Surgery after birth Meningocele involves surgery to put the meninges back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Because the spinal cord develops normally in babies with meningocele, these membranes often can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that's associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby's brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord. Treatment for complications In babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications - such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems or hydrocephalus - typically begins soon after birth. Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life, but less often as children grow. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. - For children, a specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida is the best choice. - Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a ventricular shunt - a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen. This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be used, but candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain. - Treatment and management of other complications. To help with functioning, special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may be needed. Whatever the issue - orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems, or others - most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life. Ongoing care Children with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation. Their primary care doctors follow growth, the need for immunizations and general medical issues. They coordinate your child's medical care. Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child's condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible."

            "text": "The conditions you've mentioned\u2014Spina Bifida, Vertebral Fusion, and Syrinx with Tethered Cord\u2014are complex spinal issues that often require multidisciplinary management. Treatment plans are highly individualized based on the specific characteristics of the condition, the patient's age, and overall health. Here's a general overview of each condition and potential treatment approaches:\n\n### 1. **Spina Bifida**\n\nSpina bifida is a congenital defect where the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It's a type of neural tube defect (NTD). There are different types, including spina bifida occulta, meningocele, myelomeningocele (MMC), and closed neural tube defects.\n\n- **Treatment:** The treatment for spina bifida depends on its severity and type. Surgical intervention is often necessary. For myelomeningocele, the most severe form, surgery is typically performed shortly after birth to close the opening in the back and prevent infection. Children may also require a shunt to drain fluid from the brain if hydrocephalus develops. Physical therapy, braces, and mobility aids may be necessary as the child grows.\n\n### 2. **Vertebral Fusion**\n\nVertebral fusion, or spinal fusion, can refer to either a congenital condition where two or more vertebrae are abnormally joined together or a surgical procedure that aims to fuse vertebrae together. When it's a congenital issue or a complication, it might be associated with spina bifida or other spinal dysmorphias.\n\n- **Treatment:** For congenital vertebral fusion, treatment focuses on the associated neurological issues and mobility. If the fusion leads to spinal deformity or neurological issues, surgical separation of the vertebrae might be considered. In cases where vertebral fusion is a surgical procedure to stabilize the spine, treatment involves postoperative care, physical therapy, and sometimes brace use.\n\n### 3. **Syrinx with Tethered Cord**\n\nA syrinx is a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord, which can expand and cause damage. A tethered cord syndrome occurs when the spinal cord becomes attached to the spine and cannot move freely. This can lead to progressive stretching of the spinal cord and can be associated with spina bifida.\n\n- **Treatment:** The primary treatment for a tethered cord is surgical release of the spinal cord. For syringomyelia (the presence of a syrinx), treatment aims to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and can include surgery to drain the syrinx or to correct the underlying cause. In some cases, especially if there's a tethered cord, releasing the cord can help alleviate syrinx formation.\n\n### General Treatment and Management\n\n- **Multidisciplinary Care:** Patients with these conditions often benefit from care provided by a team including neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons specializing in spinal disorders, physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) doctors, physical therapists, and urologists.\n\n- **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of neurological function, bladder and bowel function, and pain levels is crucial.\n\n- **Surgical Intervention:** Surgery may be required to address instability, deformity, or neurological decline.\n\n- **Assistive Devices:** Use of braces, wheelchairs, and other devices may be necessary to improve mobility and independence.\n\n- **Physical Therapy:** Essential for maintaining strength and mobility.\n\n### Note\n\nThe specifics of treatment, including the timing and type of surgical intervention, depend heavily on the individual case. These conditions are complex and require personalized care from specialists experienced in spinal disorders and neurosurgery. If you or someone you know has these conditions, consult a healthcare professional for a detailed evaluation and discussion of treatment options.",

Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child's condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back. If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).

Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back. If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture). If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Dizziness: Dizziness is a term used to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or unsteady. Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It's usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) - Lightheadedness or feeling faint - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache - Ongoing vomiting - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing - Stumbling or difficulty walking - Fainting - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate - Numbness or weakness - Shortness of breath - A high fever - A very stiff neck - A head injury - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis. - Meniere's disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear. - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension. - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance. - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much. - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia). - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety. - Overheating and dehydration. If you're active in hot weather, or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness. - A past episode of dizziness. If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you're having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina or blood vessel problems. - Balance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you're experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These may cause drowsiness. Nondrowsy antihistamines aren't as effective. - If your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration, rest in a cool place and drink water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others)."

            "text": "## Step 1: Understand the relationship between macular degeneration and dizziness\nMacular degeneration primarily affects vision, causing loss of central vision. It typically does not directly cause dizziness or vertigo, as it is related to the macula, which is part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision.\n\n## 2: Consider how vision affects balance and dizziness\nThe body's sense of balance and spatial orientation is partly maintained by visual input.

Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It's usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) - Lightheadedness or feeling faint - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache - Ongoing vomiting - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing - Stumbling or difficulty walking - Fainting - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate - Numbness or weakness - Shortness of breath - A high fever - A very stiff neck - A head injury - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis. - Meniere's disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear. - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension. - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance. - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much. - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia). - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety. - Overheating and dehydration. If you're active in hot weather, or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness. - A past episode of dizziness. If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you're having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina or blood vessel problems. - Balance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you're experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These may cause drowsiness. Nondrowsy antihistamines aren't as effective. - If your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration, rest in a cool place and drink water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others).\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers. A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers. If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include: - Antidepressants - Blood pressure medicines - Seizure medicines Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month. Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you. TREATING AN ATTACK Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that: - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine. - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys. If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.\u00a0The group of medicines most often used is called triptans. Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself. Feverfew is an herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs."

The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers. A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers. If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include: - Antidepressants - Blood pressure medicines - Seizure medicines Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month. Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you. TREATING AN ATTACK Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that: - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine. - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys. If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.\u00a0The group of medicines most often used is called triptans. Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself. Feverfew is an herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

They may recommend further testing, such as blood cultures or stool tests, to confirm whether you still have an active infection.\n2. **Get re-tested**: Your doctor may order additional tests to rule out other conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n3. **Complete a new treatment course**: If you're diagnosed with typhoid fever again, your doctor will prescribe a new course of antibiotics to help clear the infection.\n\n**Self-care tips:**\n\n1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broths, or electrolyte-rich beverages like coconut water or sports drinks.\n2. **Rest**: Get plenty of rest to help your body recover.\n3. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n\n**Prevention is key**:\n\nTo avoid re-infection, make sure to:\n\n1. **Practice good hygiene**: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating and after using the bathroom.\n2. **Avoid undercooked or raw foods**: Ensure that your food is cooked thoroughly, especially meat, poultry, and seafood.\n3. **Drink safe water**: Use bottled or filtered water for drinking and cooking.\n\nX, I hope this information helps. Please consult your doctor as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of action. Take care!\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat are the treatments for Typhoid fever?: Fluids and electrolytes may be given by IV (into a vein) or you may be asked to drink water with electrolyte packets.

Classic symptoms include an itchy, blister-like rash, fever, and general feeling of being unwell. \n- **Family History:** If you grew up in an era or in an area where chickenpox was common and there's no clear recollection of having had it, your healthcare provider might consider your likelihood of exposure.\n\n### 2. **Serological Testing**\nIf your medical history is unclear or inconclusive, your healthcare provider might recommend a blood test to check for immunity to varicella-zoster virus. This test detects antibodies against the varicella-zoster virus.\n\n- **What Test Results Mean:**\n  - **Positive Result:** A positive test result indicates that you have antibodies against the varicella-zoster virus in your blood. This usually means you've had chickenpox at some point in your life and are likely immune. \n  - **Negative Result:** A negative result suggests that you may not have had chickenpox or have very low levels of antibodies and might still be susceptible to the infection.\n\nThe most common types of tests are:\n\n- **Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA):** These are commonly used to detect antibodies against the varicella-zoster virus.\n- **Immune Adherence Hemagglutination Assay (IAHA):** Another test to detect antibodies.\n\nThe specific levels of antibodies that indicate immunity can vary slightly depending on the laboratory and the test used. Generally, a healthcare provider will interpret these results in the context of your overall health and history.\n\n### 3. **Consideration for Shingles Vaccine (Zostavax)\nThe shingles vaccine, Zostavax, is recommended for adults aged 50 years and older, regardless of whether they recall having had chickenpox. The vaccine is especially important for those who:\n- Are 50 years or older.\n- Have had chickenpox in the past (even if you don\u2019t remember having had chickenpox, you may still be at risk for shingles).\n- Have received the chickenpox vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine helps reduce the risk of developing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia (severe pain following shingles).\n\n### Conclusion\nIf you're unsure about your history of chickenpox and are in the age range for the shingles vaccine, consult with your healthcare provider. They can assess your need for the vaccine based on your age, medical history, and, if necessary, serological testing for varicella-zoster immunity. Keep in mind that recommendations and available vaccines may evolve, so always consult current guidelines or your healthcare provider for the most up-to-date advice.",

[2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4]\u00a0 CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina. This can cause vision loss on its own. If CNV does develop, anti-VEGF therapy such as Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab can control and even reverse the CNV. However anti-VEGF therapy does not stop or reverse the vision loss caused by adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, only the extra vision loss that is due to also developing CNV. [2]\u00a0 Although vision loss is usually slow, when vision is impaired significantly, people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy may be referred for low vision testing and rehabilitation. Low vision rehabilitation can help maintain and optimize reading ability and improve overall quality of life. [4] [5]"

[2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4]\u00a0 CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina. This can cause vision loss on its own. If CNV does develop, anti-VEGF therapy such as Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab can control and even reverse the CNV. However anti-VEGF therapy does not stop or reverse the vision loss caused by adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, only the extra vision loss that is due to also developing CNV. [2]\u00a0 Although vision loss is usually slow, when vision is impaired significantly, people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy may be referred for low vision testing and rehabilitation. Low vision rehabilitation can help maintain and optimize reading ability and improve overall quality of life.

              "text": "Williams syndrome: Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development. It is passed down in families (inherited). Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births. One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing - Developmental delay - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD) - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting - Inward bend of the small finger - Learning disorders - Mild to moderate intellectual disability - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music - Short, compared to the rest of the person's family - Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip - Prominent lips with an open mouth - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include: - Narrowing of some blood vessels - Farsightedness - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles - High blood pressure - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye Tests for Williams syndrome include: - Blood pressure check - Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test) - Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound - Kidney ultrasound There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms. It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice. The following organization provides additional information about Williams Syndrome: Williams Syndrome Association -- www.williams-syndrome.org About 75% of people with Williams syndrome have some intellectual disability. Most people will not live as long as normal due to the various medical issues and other possible complications. Most people require full-time caregivers and often live in supervised group homes. Complications may include: - Calcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problems - Death (in rare cases from anesthesia) - Heart failure due to narrowed blood vessels - Pain in the abdomen Many of the symptoms and signs of Williams syndrome may not be obvious at birth. Call your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome. There is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome. Prenatal testing is available for couples with a family history of Williams syndrome who wish to conceive.

It is characterized by a distinct set of physical, behavioral, and cognitive features. WS is caused by a deletion of genetic material on chromosome 7, which affects the development of various bodily systems.\n\n**Common Characteristics of Williams Syndrome:**\n\n1. **Physical Features:** Individuals with WS often have a distinctive facial appearance, including a short nose, wide mouth, and full cheeks. They may also have a small stature, heart problems, and dental issues.\n2. **Cognitive and Learning Abilities:** People with WS typically have an IQ range from 40 to 80, with strengths in verbal skills and weaknesses in spatial and visual-spatial skills.\n3. **Behavioral Traits:** Individuals with WS are known for their friendly, outgoing, and social personalities. They often have a strong desire for social interaction and may be overly trusting of strangers.\n4. **Medical Issues:** WS is associated with various medical problems, including heart defects, high blood pressure, and gastrointestinal issues.\n\n**Tips for Educating and Supporting Individuals with Williams Syndrome:**\n\n1. **Individualized Education Plans (IEPs):** Develop a tailored education plan that focuses on the individual's strengths and needs. Emphasize verbal skills, social skills, and life skills training.\n2. **Structured and Predictable Environment:** Establish a daily routine that provides a sense of stability and predictability. Use visual aids and schedules to help with transitions and time management.\n3. **Social Skills Training:** Teach social skills, such as initiating and maintaining conversations, understanding personal space, and developing healthy relationships.\n4. **Positive Reinforcement and Encouragement:** Foster a supportive and encouraging environment that promotes self-esteem and confidence.\n5. **Life Skills Training:** Teach essential life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and managing finances, to promote independence.\n6. **Inclusive and Supportive Community:** Encourage community involvement and provide opportunities for socialization with peers and role models.\n\n**Raising Awareness and Educating Others:**\n\n1. **Share Information:** Distribute reliable resources and information about WS to family members, educators, and caregivers.\n2. **WS Awareness Events:** Organize events, such as walks, runs, or fundraisers, to raise awareness and support for WS research and advocacy.\n3. **Training and Workshops:** Provide training and workshops for educators, healthcare professionals, and caregivers on WS and its effects on individuals and families.\n4. **Inclusive Practices:** Promote inclusive practices in schools, workplaces, and communities to ensure individuals with WS feel welcome and valued.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* Williams Syndrome Association (WSA): A leading organization dedicated to providing resources, support, and advocacy for individuals with WS and their families.\n* National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): A government agency that provides information and resources on various genetic disorders, including WS.\n\nBy spreading awareness and providing support, we can help individuals with Williams Syndrome lead fulfilling lives and reach their full potential. If you have any further questions or need more specific information, feel free to ask!\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWilliams syndrome: Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development. It is passed down in families (inherited). Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly. Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births. One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing - Developmental delay - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD) - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting - Inward bend of the small finger - Learning disorders - Mild to moderate intellectual disability - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music - Short, compared to the rest of the person's family - Sunken chest The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip - Prominent lips with an open mouth - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include: - Narrowing of some blood vessels - Farsightedness - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles - High blood pressure - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye Tests for Williams syndrome include: - Blood pressure check - Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test) - Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound - Kidney ultrasound There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is. Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms. It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice. The following organization provides additional information about Williams Syndrome: Williams Syndrome Association -- www.williams-syndrome.org About 75% of people with Williams syndrome have some intellectual disability. Most people will not live as long as normal due to the various medical issues and other possible complications. Most people require full-time caregivers and often live in supervised group homes. Complications may include: - Calcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problems - Death (in rare cases from anesthesia) - Heart failure due to narrowed blood vessels - Pain in the abdomen Many of the symptoms and signs of Williams syndrome may not be obvious at birth. Call your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome. There is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome. Prenatal testing is available for couples with a family history of Williams syndrome who wish to conceive.

              "text": "Cystic Fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis (SIS-tik fi-BRO-sis), or CF, is an inherited disease of the secretory (see-KREH-tor-ee) glands. Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the disease\u2014one from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves. CF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Overview Mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. If you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. These enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. If you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh). CF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.) Outlook The symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often. Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF. As treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. Early treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. Your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas Mucoviscidosis (MU-ko-vis-ih-DO-sis) Mucoviscidosis of the pancreas Pancreas fibrocystic disease Pancreatic cystic fibrosis A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. Research suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF. More than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. How Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited? Every person inherits two CFTR genes\u2014one from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF. Children who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. The image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. Example of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects both males and females and people from all racial and ethnic groups. However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent. CF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans. More than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers. The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body. Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF. People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage. As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis). Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. Digestive System Signs and Symptoms In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines. As a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as: Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain. Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. Diabetes. Gallstones. Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms Men who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis. Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications. Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia. Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests. Newborn Screening All States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly. Sweat Test If a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat. For this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling. Sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF. Other Tests If you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Genetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF. A chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air. A sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. A sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment. Prenatal Screening If you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). In amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal. In CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing People who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children. If you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier. A genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include: Preventing and controlling lung infections Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines Providing enough nutrition Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body) Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital. Specialists Involved If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF. Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers. The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. Treatment for Lung Problems The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Chest Physical Therapy CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up. You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs. Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as: An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor. An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up. A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus. A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls. Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways. Exercise Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition. However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood. If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first. Medicines If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older). Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital. Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral. Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms. Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. If other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include: Exercise training Nutritional counseling Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it Energy-conserving techniques Breathing strategies Psychological counseling and/or group support PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR. For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article. Treatment for Digestive Problems CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs. In addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include: Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins. Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb. High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients. A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising. A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep. Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes. Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density. If you or your child has cystic fibrosis (CF), you should learn as much as you can about the disease. Work closely with your doctors to learn how to manage CF. Ongoing Care Having ongoing medical care by a team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists who specialize in CF is important. These specialists often are located at major medical centers or CF Care Centers. The United States has more than 100 CF Care Centers. Most of these centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. It's standard to have CF checkups every 3 months. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get an annual flu shot and other vaccines. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. In between checkups, be sure to contact your doctor if you have: Blood in your mucus, increased amounts of mucus, or a change in the color or consistency of your mucus. Decreased energy or appetite. Severe constipation or diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or vomit that's dark green. A fever, which is a sign of infection. (However, you may still have a serious infection that needs treatment even if you don't have a fever.) Transition of Care Better treatments for CF allow people who have the disease to live longer now than in the past. Thus, the move from pediatric care to adult care is an important step in treatment. If your child has CF, encourage him or her to learn about the disease and take an active role in treatment. This will help prepare your child for the transition to adult care. CF Care Centers can help provide age-appropriate treatment throughout the transition period and into adulthood. They also will support the transition to adult care by balancing medical needs with other developmental factors, such as increased independence, relationships, and employment. Talk with your child's health care team for more information about how to help your child move from pediatric care to adult care. Lifestyle Changes In between medical checkups, you can practice good self-care and follow a healthy lifestyle. For example, follow a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of foods you should include in your diet. Other lifestyle changes include: Not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke Washing your hands often to lower your risk of infection Exercising regularly and drinking lots of fluids Doing chest physical therapy (as your doctor recommends) Other Concerns Although CF requires daily care, most people who have the disease are able to attend school and work. Adults who have CF can expect to have normal sex lives. Most men who have the disease are infertile (unable to have children). However, modern fertility treatments may help them. Women who have CF may find it hard to get pregnant, but they usually can have children. If you have CF, you should talk with your doctor if you're planning a pregnancy. Although CF can cause fertility problems, men and women who have the disease should still have protected sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Emotional Issues Living with CF may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with CF. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you."

Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the disease\u2014one from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves. CF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Overview Mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. If you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. These enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. If you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh). CF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.) Outlook The symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often. Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF. As treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. Early treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. Your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas Mucoviscidosis (MU-ko-vis-ih-DO-sis) Mucoviscidosis of the pancreas Pancreas fibrocystic disease Pancreatic cystic fibrosis A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. Research suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF. More than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. How Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited? Every person inherits two CFTR genes\u2014one from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF. Children who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. The image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. Example of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects both males and females and people from all racial and ethnic groups. However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent. CF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans. More than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers. The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body. Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF. People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage. As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis). Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. Digestive System Signs and Symptoms In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines. As a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as: Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain. Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. Diabetes. Gallstones. Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms Men who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis. Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications. Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia. Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests. Newborn Screening All States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly. Sweat Test If a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat. For this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling. Sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF. Other Tests If you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Genetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF. A chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air. A sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. A sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment. Prenatal Screening If you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). In amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal. In CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing People who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children. If you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier. A genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include: Preventing and controlling lung infections Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines Providing enough nutrition Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body) Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital. Specialists Involved If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF. Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers. The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. Treatment for Lung Problems The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Chest Physical Therapy CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up. You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs. Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as: An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor. An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up. A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus. A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls. Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways. Exercise Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition. However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood. If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first. Medicines If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older). Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital. Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral. Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms. Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. If other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include: Exercise training Nutritional counseling Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it Energy-conserving techniques Breathing strategies Psychological counseling and/or group support PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR. For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article. Treatment for Digestive Problems CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs. In addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include: Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins. Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb. High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients. A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising. A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep. Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes. Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density. If you or your child has cystic fibrosis (CF), you should learn as much as you can about the disease. Work closely with your doctors to learn how to manage CF. Ongoing Care Having ongoing medical care by a team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists who specialize in CF is important. These specialists often are located at major medical centers or CF Care Centers. The United States has more than 100 CF Care Centers. Most of these centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. It's standard to have CF checkups every 3 months. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get an annual flu shot and other vaccines. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. In between checkups, be sure to contact your doctor if you have: Blood in your mucus, increased amounts of mucus, or a change in the color or consistency of your mucus. Decreased energy or appetite. Severe constipation or diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or vomit that's dark green. A fever, which is a sign of infection. (However, you may still have a serious infection that needs treatment even if you don't have a fever.) Transition of Care Better treatments for CF allow people who have the disease to live longer now than in the past. Thus, the move from pediatric care to adult care is an important step in treatment. If your child has CF, encourage him or her to learn about the disease and take an active role in treatment. This will help prepare your child for the transition to adult care. CF Care Centers can help provide age-appropriate treatment throughout the transition period and into adulthood. They also will support the transition to adult care by balancing medical needs with other developmental factors, such as increased independence, relationships, and employment. Talk with your child's health care team for more information about how to help your child move from pediatric care to adult care. Lifestyle Changes In between medical checkups, you can practice good self-care and follow a healthy lifestyle. For example, follow a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of foods you should include in your diet. Other lifestyle changes include: Not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke Washing your hands often to lower your risk of infection Exercising regularly and drinking lots of fluids Doing chest physical therapy (as your doctor recommends) Other Concerns Although CF requires daily care, most people who have the disease are able to attend school and work. Adults who have CF can expect to have normal sex lives. Most men who have the disease are infertile (unable to have children). However, modern fertility treatments may help them. Women who have CF may find it hard to get pregnant, but they usually can have children. If you have CF, you should talk with your doctor if you're planning a pregnancy. Although CF can cause fertility problems, men and women who have the disease should still have protected sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Emotional Issues Living with CF may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with CF. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety.

              "text": "Fragile X Syndrome: The genetic disorder Fragile X syndrome, which results from mutations in a gene on the X chromosome, is the most commonly inherited form of developmental and intellectual disability. The NICHD supports and conducts research on the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and inheritance of Fragile X and its associated conditions, Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). All three conditions result from changes in the same gene on the X chromosome.\u00a0 What is Fragile X syndrome? Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a person\u2019s development, especially that person\u2019s behavior and ability to learn. In addition, Fragile X can affect: - Communication skills - Physical appearance - Sensitivity to noise, light, or other sensory information Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) People with Fragile X syndrome may not have noticeable symptoms, or they can have more serious symptoms that range from learning disabilities to cognitive and behavior problems. How is FMR1 mutation related? \u00bb Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by changes (mutations) in the FMR1 gene found on the X chromosome. This mutation affects how the body makes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which can cause the symptoms of Fragile X. In a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps to start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene includes many repeats\u2014repeated instances of a specific DNA sequence called the CGG sequence. A normal FMR1 gene has between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. People with between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation of the gene. The premutation may cause the gene to not work properly, but it does not cause intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The premutation is linked to the disorders FXPOI and FXTAS. However, not all people with the premutation show symptoms of FXPOI or FXTAS. People with 200 or more repeats in the promoter part of the gene have a full mutation, meaning the gene might not work at all. People with a full mutation often have Fragile X syndrome. The number of repeats, also called the \u201csize of the mutation,\u201d affects the type of symptoms and how serious the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome will be. Inheriting Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to children. Anyone with the FMR1 gene mutation can pass it to their children. However, a person who inherits the gene mutation may not develop Fragile X syndrome. Males will pass it down to all of their daughters and not their sons. Females have a 50/50 chance to pass it along to both their sons and daughters. In some cases, an FMR1 premutation can change to a full mutation when it is passed from parent to child. Read more about how FMR1 changes as it is passed from parent to child. \u00ab\u00a0 Condition Information What causes it?\u00a0\u00bb Fragile X results from a change or mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which is found on the X chromosome. The gene normally makes a protein called Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. This protein is important for creating and maintaining connections between cells in the brain and nervous system. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which often causes the symptoms of Fragile X. Not everyone with the mutated FMR1 gene has symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, because the body may still be able to make FMRP. A few things affect how much FMRP the body can make: - The size of the mutation. Some people have a smaller mutation (a lower number of repeats) in their FMR1 gene, while others have big mutations (a large number of repeats) in the gene. If the mutation is small, the body may be able to make some of the protein. Having the protein available makes the symptoms milder. - The number of cells that have the mutation. Because not every cell in the body is exactly the same, some cells might have the FMR1 mutation while others do not. This situation is called mosaicism (pronounced moh-ZAY-uh-siz-uhm). If the mutation is in most of the body\u2019s cells, the person will probably have symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. If the mutation is in only some of the cells, the person might not have any symptoms at all or only mild symptoms. - Being female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have only one. In females, if the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome has the mutation, the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome might not have the mutation. Even if one of the female\u2019s genes has a very large mutation, the body can usually make at least some FMRP, leading to milder symptoms. \u00ab\u00a0 How is FMR1 mutation related? How many people are affected?\u00a0\u00bb About 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females have Fragile X syndrome. How many people have the Fragile X premutation? Although Fragile X syndrome is relatively rare, premutations in the FMR1 gene are relatively common: A recent study of 6,747 people found that 1 in 151 women and 1 in 468 men had the premutation. People with the premutation might not have any symptoms of Fragile X. However, the premutation can sometimes expand in the next generation, which can cause Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What causes it? What are common symptoms\u00a0\u00bb People with Fragile X do not all have the same signs and symptoms, but they do have some things in common. Symptoms are often milder in females than in males. - Intelligence and learning. Many people with Fragile X have problems with intellectual functioning. - These problems can range from the mild, such as learning disorders or problems with mathematics, to the severe, such as an intellectual or developmental disability. - The syndrome may affect the ability to think, reason, and learn. - Because many people with Fragile X also have attention disorders, hyperactivity, anxiety, and language-processing problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score suggests. - Physical. Most infants and younger children with Fragile X don\u2019t have any specific physical features of this syndrome. When these children start to go through puberty, however, many will begin to develop certain features that are typical of those with Fragile X. - These features include a narrow face, large head, large ears, flexible joints, flat feet, and a prominent forehead. - These physical signs become more obvious with age. - Behavioral, social, and emotional. Most children with Fragile X have some behavioral challenges. - They may be afraid or anxious in new situations. - They may have trouble making eye contact with other people. - Boys, especially, may have trouble paying attention or be aggressive. - Girls may be shy around new people. They may also have attention disorders and problems with hyperactivity. - Speech and language. Most boys with Fragile X have some problems with speech and language. - They may have trouble speaking clearly, may stutter, or may leave out parts of words. They may also have problems understanding other people\u2019s social cues, such as tone of voice or specific types of body language. - Girls usually do not have severe problems with speech or language. - Some children with Fragile X begin talking later than typically developing children. Most will talk eventually, but a few might stay nonverbal throughout their lives. - Sensory. Many children with Fragile X are bothered by certain sensations, such as bright light, loud noises, or the way certain clothing feels on their bodies. - These sensory issues might cause them to act out or display behavior problems. \u00ab\u00a0 How many people are affected? How is it diagnosed?\u00a0\u00bb Health care providers often use a blood sample to diagnose Fragile X. The health care provider will take a sample of blood and will send it to a laboratory, which will determine what form of the FMR1 gene is present. Prenatal Testing (During Pregnancy) Pregnant women who have an FMR1 premutation or full mutation may pass that mutated gene on to their children. A prenatal test allows health care providers to detect the mutated gene in the developing fetus. This important information helps families and providers to prepare for Fragile X syndrome and to intervene as early as possible. Possible types of prenatal tests include: - Amniocentesis (pronounced am-nee-oh-sen-TEE-sis). A health care provider takes a sample of amniotic (pronounced am-nee-OT-ik) fluid, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. - Chorionic villus (pronounced KOHR-ee-on-ik VILL-uhs) sampling. A health care provider takes a sample of cells from the placenta, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. Because prenatal testing involves some risk to the mother and fetus, if you or a family member is considering prenatal testing for Fragile X, discuss all the risks and benefits with your health care provider. Prenatal testing is not very common, and many parents do not know they carry the mutation. Therefore, parents usually start to notice symptoms in their children when they are infants or toddlers. The average age at diagnosis is 36 months for boys and 42 months for girls. Diagnosis of Children Many parents first notice symptoms of delayed development in their infants or toddlers. These symptoms may include delays in speech and language skills, social and emotional difficulties, and being sensitive to certain sensations. Children may also be delayed in or have problems with motor skills such as learning to walk. A health care provider can perform developmental screening to determine the nature of delays in a child. If a health care provider suspects the child has Fragile X syndrome, he/she can refer parents to a clinical geneticist, who can perform a genetic test for Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What are common symptoms? What are the treatments?\u00a0\u00bb \u200b\u200b There is no single treatment for Fragile X syndrome, but there are treatments that help minimize the symptoms of the condition. Individuals with Fragile X who receive appropriate education, therapy services, and medications have the best chance of using all of their individual capabilities and skills. Even those with an intellectual or developmental disability can learn to master many self-help skills. Early intervention is important. Because a young child\u2019s brain is still forming, early intervention gives children the best start possible and the greatest chance of developing a full range of skills. The sooner a child with Fragile X syndrome gets treatment, the more opportunity there is for learning. \u00ab How is it diagnosed? Educational treatments \u00bb Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? Among the other conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome are the following: - Autism spectrum disorder. From 30% to 50% of people with Fragile X also meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. - Mitral valve prolapse. In mitral valve prolapse (pronounced MY-truhl valv PROH-laps), a heart condition, the valve that separates the upper and lower left chambers of the heart does not work properly. This condition is usually not life-threatening, but in severe cases, surgery might be required to correct the problem. - Seizures. Between 6% and 20% of children with Fragile X syndrome have seizures. Seizures associated with the syndrome are more common in boys than in girls. [top] How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? The gene for Fragile X is carried on the X chromosome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children. - A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will pass that gene on only to his daughters. To his sons he will pass on a Y chromosome, which doesn\u2019t transmit Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, a father with the altered gene on his X chromosome and a mother with normal X chromosomes would have daughters with the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene. - A father can pass on the premutation form of the FMR1 gene to his daughters but not the full mutation. Even if the father himself has a full mutation of this gene, it appears that sperm can carry only the premutation. Scientists don\u2019t understand how or why fathers can pass on only the milder form of Fragile X to their daughters. This remains an area of focused research. - Mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, so if a mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If a mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene. - These 50-50 odds apply for each child the parents have. Having one child with the FMR1 mutation does not increase or decrease the chances of having another child with the mutated FMR1 gene. This is also true for the severity of the symptoms. Having one child with mild symptoms does not mean that the other children will have severe symptoms, and having a child with severe symptoms does not mean that the other children will have mild symptoms. [top] How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? The repeats in the promoter part of the FMR1 gene are unstable, and sometimes the number of repeats increases from one generation to the next. A premutation gene is less stable than a full mutation gene. So as it passes from parent to child, a premutation gene might expand to become a full mutation gene. The chances of expansion depend on the number of repeats in the promoter of the premutation gene: Normal FMR1 genes that have 5 to 44 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered normal. When these genes are passed from parent to child, the number of repeats does not increase or decrease. Intermediate FMR1 genes with 45 to 54 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered intermediate, or borderline. An intermediate gene may expand from one generation to the next, depending on which parent has the gene. Mother to Child About 14% of the time, when a mother passes an intermediate gene to her child, the CGG repeats increase to a number seen with premutations. Research shows that an intermediate gene will not become a full mutation gene in one generation, and so a mother with an intermediate gene will not have a child with a full mutation. Father to Child When intermediate genes are transmitted from father to child, they are generally stable and do not increase to premutations. Premutations Premutation (55 to 199 CGG repeats) FMR1 genes can expand to a full mutation from one generation to the next. The risk of expansion depends on which parent has the gene and the number of repeats in that gene. Mother to Child An FMR1 gene from the mother with 100 CGG repeats is very likely to expand to a full mutation when passed to the child. An FMR1 gene from the mother with 70 to 79 CGG repeats has about a 30% chance of expanding to a full mutation in one generation. Father to Child Premutations passed from father to child have almost no chance of expanding to full mutations. [top] \u00ab What are the Treatments?"

It is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Fragile X syndrome affects approximately 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 6,000 people worldwide. In the United States, it is estimated that about 1 in 7,000 children have FXS.\n\nMales are more frequently affected than females, with a ratio of about 1.4:1. This is because males have one X chromosome, and if it carries the mutation, they are more likely to express the full syndrome. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, and if one carries the mutation, the other X chromosome can compensate, resulting in milder symptoms or no symptoms at all.\n\nOverall, Fragile X syndrome is a relatively common genetic disorder that affects a significant number of people worldwide. If you have concerns about FXS or suspect that you or a family member may be affected, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for evaluation and testing.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nFragile X Syndrome: The genetic disorder Fragile X syndrome, which results from mutations in a gene on the X chromosome, is the most commonly inherited form of developmental and intellectual disability. The NICHD supports and conducts research on the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and inheritance of Fragile X and its associated conditions, Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). All three conditions result from changes in the same gene on the X chromosome.\u00a0 What is Fragile X syndrome? Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a person\u2019s development, especially that person\u2019s behavior and ability to learn. In addition, Fragile X can affect: - Communication skills - Physical appearance - Sensitivity to noise, light, or other sensory information Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) People with Fragile X syndrome may not have noticeable symptoms, or they can have more serious symptoms that range from learning disabilities to cognitive and behavior problems. How is FMR1 mutation related? \u00bb Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by changes (mutations) in the FMR1 gene found on the X chromosome. This mutation affects how the body makes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which can cause the symptoms of Fragile X. In a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps to start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene includes many repeats\u2014repeated instances of a specific DNA sequence called the CGG sequence. A normal FMR1 gene has between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. People with between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation of the gene. The premutation may cause the gene to not work properly, but it does not cause intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The premutation is linked to the disorders FXPOI and FXTAS. However, not all people with the premutation show symptoms of FXPOI or FXTAS. People with 200 or more repeats in the promoter part of the gene have a full mutation, meaning the gene might not work at all. People with a full mutation often have Fragile X syndrome. The number of repeats, also called the \u201csize of the mutation,\u201d affects the type of symptoms and how serious the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome will be. Inheriting Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to children. Anyone with the FMR1 gene mutation can pass it to their children. However, a person who inherits the gene mutation may not develop Fragile X syndrome. Males will pass it down to all of their daughters and not their sons. Females have a 50/50 chance to pass it along to both their sons and daughters. In some cases, an FMR1 premutation can change to a full mutation when it is passed from parent to child. Read more about how FMR1 changes as it is passed from parent to child. \u00ab\u00a0 Condition Information What causes it?\u00a0\u00bb Fragile X results from a change or mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which is found on the X chromosome. The gene normally makes a protein called Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. This protein is important for creating and maintaining connections between cells in the brain and nervous system. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which often causes the symptoms of Fragile X. Not everyone with the mutated FMR1 gene has symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, because the body may still be able to make FMRP. A few things affect how much FMRP the body can make: - The size of the mutation. Some people have a smaller mutation (a lower number of repeats) in their FMR1 gene, while others have big mutations (a large number of repeats) in the gene. If the mutation is small, the body may be able to make some of the protein. Having the protein available makes the symptoms milder. - The number of cells that have the mutation. Because not every cell in the body is exactly the same, some cells might have the FMR1 mutation while others do not. This situation is called mosaicism (pronounced moh-ZAY-uh-siz-uhm). If the mutation is in most of the body\u2019s cells, the person will probably have symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. If the mutation is in only some of the cells, the person might not have any symptoms at all or only mild symptoms. - Being female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have only one. In females, if the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome has the mutation, the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome might not have the mutation. Even if one of the female\u2019s genes has a very large mutation, the body can usually make at least some FMRP, leading to milder symptoms. \u00ab\u00a0 How is FMR1 mutation related? How many people are affected?\u00a0\u00bb About 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females have Fragile X syndrome. How many people have the Fragile X premutation? Although Fragile X syndrome is relatively rare, premutations in the FMR1 gene are relatively common: A recent study of 6,747 people found that 1 in 151 women and 1 in 468 men had the premutation. People with the premutation might not have any symptoms of Fragile X. However, the premutation can sometimes expand in the next generation, which can cause Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What causes it? What are common symptoms\u00a0\u00bb People with Fragile X do not all have the same signs and symptoms, but they do have some things in common. Symptoms are often milder in females than in males. - Intelligence and learning. Many people with Fragile X have problems with intellectual functioning. - These problems can range from the mild, such as learning disorders or problems with mathematics, to the severe, such as an intellectual or developmental disability. - The syndrome may affect the ability to think, reason, and learn. - Because many people with Fragile X also have attention disorders, hyperactivity, anxiety, and language-processing problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score suggests. - Physical. Most infants and younger children with Fragile X don\u2019t have any specific physical features of this syndrome. When these children start to go through puberty, however, many will begin to develop certain features that are typical of those with Fragile X. - These features include a narrow face, large head, large ears, flexible joints, flat feet, and a prominent forehead. - These physical signs become more obvious with age. - Behavioral, social, and emotional. Most children with Fragile X have some behavioral challenges. - They may be afraid or anxious in new situations. - They may have trouble making eye contact with other people. - Boys, especially, may have trouble paying attention or be aggressive. - Girls may be shy around new people. They may also have attention disorders and problems with hyperactivity. - Speech and language. Most boys with Fragile X have some problems with speech and language. - They may have trouble speaking clearly, may stutter, or may leave out parts of words. They may also have problems understanding other people\u2019s social cues, such as tone of voice or specific types of body language. - Girls usually do not have severe problems with speech or language. - Some children with Fragile X begin talking later than typically developing children. Most will talk eventually, but a few might stay nonverbal throughout their lives. - Sensory. Many children with Fragile X are bothered by certain sensations, such as bright light, loud noises, or the way certain clothing feels on their bodies. - These sensory issues might cause them to act out or display behavior problems. \u00ab\u00a0 How many people are affected? How is it diagnosed?\u00a0\u00bb Health care providers often use a blood sample to diagnose Fragile X. The health care provider will take a sample of blood and will send it to a laboratory, which will determine what form of the FMR1 gene is present. Prenatal Testing (During Pregnancy) Pregnant women who have an FMR1 premutation or full mutation may pass that mutated gene on to their children. A prenatal test allows health care providers to detect the mutated gene in the developing fetus. This important information helps families and providers to prepare for Fragile X syndrome and to intervene as early as possible. Possible types of prenatal tests include: - Amniocentesis (pronounced am-nee-oh-sen-TEE-sis). A health care provider takes a sample of amniotic (pronounced am-nee-OT-ik) fluid, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. - Chorionic villus (pronounced KOHR-ee-on-ik VILL-uhs) sampling. A health care provider takes a sample of cells from the placenta, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. Because prenatal testing involves some risk to the mother and fetus, if you or a family member is considering prenatal testing for Fragile X, discuss all the risks and benefits with your health care provider. Prenatal testing is not very common, and many parents do not know they carry the mutation. Therefore, parents usually start to notice symptoms in their children when they are infants or toddlers. The average age at diagnosis is 36 months for boys and 42 months for girls. Diagnosis of Children Many parents first notice symptoms of delayed development in their infants or toddlers. These symptoms may include delays in speech and language skills, social and emotional difficulties, and being sensitive to certain sensations. Children may also be delayed in or have problems with motor skills such as learning to walk. A health care provider can perform developmental screening to determine the nature of delays in a child. If a health care provider suspects the child has Fragile X syndrome, he/she can refer parents to a clinical geneticist, who can perform a genetic test for Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What are common symptoms? What are the treatments?\u00a0\u00bb \u200b\u200b There is no single treatment for Fragile X syndrome, but there are treatments that help minimize the symptoms of the condition. Individuals with Fragile X who receive appropriate education, therapy services, and medications have the best chance of using all of their individual capabilities and skills. Even those with an intellectual or developmental disability can learn to master many self-help skills. Early intervention is important. Because a young child\u2019s brain is still forming, early intervention gives children the best start possible and the greatest chance of developing a full range of skills. The sooner a child with Fragile X syndrome gets treatment, the more opportunity there is for learning. \u00ab How is it diagnosed? Educational treatments \u00bb Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? Among the other conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome are the following: - Autism spectrum disorder. From 30% to 50% of people with Fragile X also meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. - Mitral valve prolapse. In mitral valve prolapse (pronounced MY-truhl valv PROH-laps), a heart condition, the valve that separates the upper and lower left chambers of the heart does not work properly. This condition is usually not life-threatening, but in severe cases, surgery might be required to correct the problem. - Seizures. Between 6% and 20% of children with Fragile X syndrome have seizures. Seizures associated with the syndrome are more common in boys than in girls. [top] How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? The gene for Fragile X is carried on the X chromosome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children. - A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will pass that gene on only to his daughters. To his sons he will pass on a Y chromosome, which doesn\u2019t transmit Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, a father with the altered gene on his X chromosome and a mother with normal X chromosomes would have daughters with the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene. - A father can pass on the premutation form of the FMR1 gene to his daughters but not the full mutation. Even if the father himself has a full mutation of this gene, it appears that sperm can carry only the premutation. Scientists don\u2019t understand how or why fathers can pass on only the milder form of Fragile X to their daughters. This remains an area of focused research. - Mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, so if a mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If a mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene. - These 50-50 odds apply for each child the parents have. Having one child with the FMR1 mutation does not increase or decrease the chances of having another child with the mutated FMR1 gene. This is also true for the severity of the symptoms. Having one child with mild symptoms does not mean that the other children will have severe symptoms, and having a child with severe symptoms does not mean that the other children will have mild symptoms. [top] How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? The repeats in the promoter part of the FMR1 gene are unstable, and sometimes the number of repeats increases from one generation to the next. A premutation gene is less stable than a full mutation gene. So as it passes from parent to child, a premutation gene might expand to become a full mutation gene. The chances of expansion depend on the number of repeats in the promoter of the premutation gene: Normal FMR1 genes that have 5 to 44 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered normal. When these genes are passed from parent to child, the number of repeats does not increase or decrease. Intermediate FMR1 genes with 45 to 54 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered intermediate, or borderline. An intermediate gene may expand from one generation to the next, depending on which parent has the gene. Mother to Child About 14% of the time, when a mother passes an intermediate gene to her child, the CGG repeats increase to a number seen with premutations. Research shows that an intermediate gene will not become a full mutation gene in one generation, and so a mother with an intermediate gene will not have a child with a full mutation. Father to Child When intermediate genes are transmitted from father to child, they are generally stable and do not increase to premutations. Premutations Premutation (55 to 199 CGG repeats) FMR1 genes can expand to a full mutation from one generation to the next. The risk of expansion depends on which parent has the gene and the number of repeats in that gene. Mother to Child An FMR1 gene from the mother with 100 CGG repeats is very likely to expand to a full mutation when passed to the child. An FMR1 gene from the mother with 70 to 79 CGG repeats has about a 30% chance of expanding to a full mutation in one generation. Father to Child Premutations passed from father to child have almost no chance of expanding to full mutations.

Here are some tips to help:\n\n1. **Stay physically active**: Regular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of dementia. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week.\n2. **Maintain a healthy diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce the risk of dementia. Consider following a Mediterranean-style diet.\n3. **Manage chronic conditions**: Certain conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, can increase the risk of dementia. Work with your healthcare provider to manage these conditions.\n4. **Don't smoke**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for dementia. Quitting smoking can help reduce your risk.\n5. **Stay mentally active**: Engage in mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, puzzles, and learning new skills, to help build cognitive reserve.\n6. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help reduce the risk of dementia.\n7. **Stay socially engaged**: Social isolation and loneliness can increase the risk of dementia. Stay connected with friends and family, and engage in activities that bring you joy.\n8. **Limit alcohol consumption**: Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of dementia. Limit your alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day for women, and two drinks per day for men.\n9. **Get vaccinated**: Certain infections, such as flu and pneumonia, can increase the risk of dementia. Stay up-to-date on recommended vaccinations.\n10. **Monitor your cognitive health**: If you're concerned about your cognitive health, talk to your healthcare provider. They can help assess your risk and provide guidance on maintaining cognitive health.\n\nAdditionally, some potential risk-reducing strategies that are being researched include:\n\n* **Omega-3 supplements**: Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplements may help reduce the risk of dementia.\n* **B vitamins**: Some research suggests that B vitamins, particularly B6, B9, and B12, may help reduce the risk of dementia.\n* **Antioxidants**: Antioxidants, such as vitamin E and polyphenols, may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which can contribute to dementia.\n\nIt's essential to note that while these steps may help reduce the risk of dementia, they are no guarantee against developing the condition. Genetics, age, and other factors can still play a role. If you have concerns about your risk or cognitive health, consult with your healthcare provider.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nDementia (Prevention): Most causes of dementia are not preventable.

To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease."

Here's a general overview:\n\n**Type 1 Diabetes:**\nThis type of diabetes is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. As a result, the body is unable to produce enough insulin, and blood sugar levels rise. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is not known, but it's believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n**Type 2 Diabetes:**\nThis type of diabetes is the most common form and is often associated with lifestyle factors. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells. Over time, the pancreas may also produce less insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. The risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes include:\n\n1. **Genetics:** Family history and genetic predisposition play a significant role.\n2. **Obesity:** Being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.\n3. **Physical inactivity:** A sedentary lifestyle can contribute to insulin resistance and increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n4. **Unhealthy diet:** Consuming a diet high in sugar, saturated fats, and low in fiber can increase the risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.\n5. **Age:** The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after the age of 45.\n6. **Other health conditions:** Having conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can increase the risk.\n\n**Gestational Diabetes:**\nThis type of diabetes develops during pregnancy, usually in the second or third trimester. It's caused by hormonal changes and insulin resistance, which can lead to high blood sugar levels. Women who are overweight, have a family history of diabetes, or have had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy are more likely to develop it.\n\n**Other forms of diabetes:**\nThere are other less common forms of diabetes, including:\n\n1. **LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults):** A form of type 1 diabetes that develops in adults.\n2. **MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young):** A rare form of diabetes caused by genetic mutations that affect insulin production.\n3. **Secondary diabetes:** Diabetes caused by other medical conditions or treatments, such as pancreatitis, pancreatic surgery, or certain medications.\n\nIt's essential to note that while some risk factors can't be changed, many can be managed through lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and following a balanced diet.

Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both. To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested: - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally - Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown. - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis, but the condition can also be caused by other infections, heavy alcohol use, toxins, certain medications, and autoimmune disease. There are five main virus types that cause hepatitis---type A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingesting contaminated food or water. Type B commonly occurs through contact with infected blood, semen or other bodily fluid through sex, sharing needles or other drug-injection equipment or from mother to baby at birth. Hepatitis type C is a blood-borne virus that is largely spread by sharing needles or other drug injection equipment. Hepatitis D, which is transmitted through contact with infectious blood, occurs only among people with hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B, C, and D afflict more than half a billion people worldwide and are responsible for more than a million deaths a year. Chronic infection with these viruses can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. The NIAID Hepatitis Research Program supports research on all hepatitis viruses. However, commensurate with the magnitude of the medical burdens imposed by these viruses, the greatest emphasis is placed on the study of hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses, which focuses on the understanding the pathogenesis and immunology of hepatitis viruses and developing novel therapeutics and vaccines against diseases caused by hepatitis viruses. Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver. Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements Stomach pain Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer. Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent some viral forms."

Here are the most common ways to catch hepatitis C:\n\n1. **Sharing needles or syringes**: One of the most common ways to contract hepatitis C is by sharing needles or syringes contaminated with infected blood, especially among people who inject drugs.\n2. **Blood transfusions**: Before 1992, blood transfusions were not routinely screened for hepatitis C, so people who received blood transfusions before that time may be at risk. (In the US and many other countries, blood supplies have been screened for hepatitis C since 1992.)\n3. **Organ transplants**: Similar to blood transfusions, organ transplants from donors who were infected with hepatitis C could transmit the virus to the recipient.\n4. **Tattooing and body piercing**: If tattoo or piercing equipment is not properly sterilized, it can spread hepatitis C through infected blood.\n5. **Sexual contact**: Although less common, hepatitis C can be transmitted through sexual contact, especially if it's unprotected and involves multiple partners or a partner with a history of injection drug use.\n6. **Mother-to-child transmission**: Pregnant women with hepatitis C can pass the infection to their babies during childbirth.\n7. **Household exposure**: Sharing personal items, like razors, toothbrushes, or nail clippers, with someone who has hepatitis C may pose a small risk of transmission if those items come into contact with infected blood.\n\nIt's essential to note that hepatitis C is not spread through:\n\n* Casual contact, like shaking hands or hugging\n* Sharing food or drinks\n* Breastfeeding (if the nipples are not cracked or bleeding)\n* Mosquito bites\n\nIf you're concerned about your risk of contracting hepatitis C, consult your healthcare provider for guidance on testing and prevention.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHepatitis: Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis, but the condition can also be caused by other infections, heavy alcohol use, toxins, certain medications, and autoimmune disease. There are five main virus types that cause hepatitis---type A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingesting contaminated food or water. Type B commonly occurs through contact with infected blood, semen or other bodily fluid through sex, sharing needles or other drug-injection equipment or from mother to baby at birth. Hepatitis type C is a blood-borne virus that is largely spread by sharing needles or other drug injection equipment. Hepatitis D, which is transmitted through contact with infectious blood, occurs only among people with hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B, C, and D afflict more than half a billion people worldwide and are responsible for more than a million deaths a year. Chronic infection with these viruses can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. The NIAID Hepatitis Research Program supports research on all hepatitis viruses. However, commensurate with the magnitude of the medical burdens imposed by these viruses, the greatest emphasis is placed on the study of hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses, which focuses on the understanding the pathogenesis and immunology of hepatitis viruses and developing novel therapeutics and vaccines against diseases caused by hepatitis viruses. Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver. Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements Stomach pain Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer. Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent some viral forms.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Dealing with a long-lasting disease like systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) can be hard on the emotions. You might think that your friends, family, and coworkers do not understand how you feel. Sadness and anger are common reactions. Besides working with your doctor to determine a treatment plan, there are a few things you can do to help you live with lupus: - Learn to recognize the warning signs of a flare so that you and your doctor might reduce or prevent them. These warning signs include: - Feeling more tired. - Pain. - Rash. - Fever. - Stomachache. - Headache. - Dizziness. - Eat a proper diet, exercise, and learn relaxation techniques to help cope with stress. A healthy lifestyle, as well as quitting smoking, will also reduce your risk for heart disease associated with lupus. Talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program. - Develop and maintain a good support system of family, friends, medical professionals, community organizations, and support groups. Pregnancy and Contraception for Women With Lupus Pregnancy in women with lupus is considered high risk, but most women with lupus carry their babies safely. There are a few things to keep in mind: - Talk to your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. - See your doctor often once you are pregnant. - Good nutrition during pregnancy is important. - Lupus can flare during pregnancy.

A physical examination will be performed to look for signs of lupus, such as skin rashes, joint inflammation, or kidney problems.\n\n2. **Laboratory Tests**:\n\t* **Blood Tests**:\n\t\t+ Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for anemia, low white blood cell count, or low platelet count.\n\t\t+ Blood chemistry tests to evaluate kidney and liver function.\n\t\t+ Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) test to detect the presence of ANA, a common marker for lupus.\n\t\t+ Anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm tests to detect specific antibodies associated with lupus.\n\t* **Urine Tests**: To check for kidney damage or proteinuria (excess protein in the urine).\n\n3. **Imaging Studies**: Imaging tests, such as X-rays, ultrasound, or MRI, may be ordered to evaluate joint inflammation, kidney damage, or other organ involvement.\n\n4. **Diagnostic Criteria**: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) have established a set of diagnostic criteria for lupus, which includes:\n\t* Presence of at least 4 of the 11 criteria:\n\t\t1. Malar rash (butterfly-shaped rash on the face)\n\t\t2. Discoid rash (coin-shaped rash on the skin)\n\t\t3. Photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight)\n\t\t4. Oral ulcers\n\t\t5. Arthritis (joint inflammation)\n\t\t6. Serositis (inflammation of the lining around the heart or lungs)\n\t\t7. Kidney disorder (persistent proteinuria or cellular casts)\n\t\t8. Seizures or psychosis\n\t\t9. Blood disorders (hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, or thrombocytopenia)\n\t\t10. Positive ANA test\n\t\t11. Positive anti-dsDNA or anti-Sm test\n\nA diagnosis of lupus is made when a patient meets at least 4 of these criteria.\n\nIt's essential to note that lupus can be challenging to diagnose, and it may take some time to confirm the diagnosis. A rheumatologist or a healthcare provider with experience in diagnosing and treating lupus will typically make the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus): - Lupus can affect many body parts, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, or brain. - You will have periods of illness (flares) and wellness. - Anyone can get lupus, but it most often affects women. Lupus is also more common among African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. - Genes play an important role in lupus, but other factors are also involved. - Most people will see a rheumatologist for their lupus treatment. Treatment generally consists of a team approach. - Learning to recognize the warning signs of a flare can help with reducing\u00a0or preventing the flares.

Voluntary muscles are the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. Your nerve cells, also called neurons, send the messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die, communication between your nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result, your muscles weaken and waste away. The weakness can lead to twitching, cramps, aches and pains, and joint and movement problems. Sometimes it also affects heart function and your ability to breathe. Examples of neuromuscular disorders include - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Spinal muscular atrophy Many neuromuscular diseases are genetic, which means they run in families or there is a mutation in your genes. Sometimes, an immune system disorder can cause them. Most of them have no cure. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms, increase mobility and lengthen life."

The causes of neuromuscular disorders can vary widely, and they can be inherited or acquired. Here are some possible ways to develop neuromuscular disorders:\n\n**Inherited Causes:**\n\n1. **Genetic mutations**: Many neuromuscular disorders are caused by genetic mutations that affect the genes responsible for muscle function and nerve communication. These mutations can be inherited from one's parents in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked pattern.\n2. **Family history**: Having a family history of neuromuscular disorders increases the risk of developing these conditions.\n\n**Acquired Causes:**\n\n1. **Autoimmune disorders**: Conditions like myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves or muscles.\n2. **Infections**: Certain infections, such as Lyme disease, can damage the nerves and lead to neuromuscular disorders.\n3. **Toxins and poisons**: Exposure to toxins like heavy metals, pesticides, or certain chemicals can damage the nervous system and muscles.\n4. **Trauma**: Physical trauma, such as spinal cord injuries or nerve damage, can lead to neuromuscular disorders.\n5. **Medications**: Certain medications, like antibiotics and statins, can cause muscle damage and lead to neuromuscular disorders.\n6. **Aging**: Age-related muscle wasting and weakness, known as sarcopenia, can be a natural process, but it can also be accelerated by various factors, such as lack of exercise, poor nutrition, and chronic diseases.\n\n**Examples of Neuromuscular Disorders:**\n\n1. Muscular dystrophy\n2. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\n3. Myasthenia gravis\n4. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\n5. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\n6.

The causes of neuromuscular disorders can vary widely, and they can be inherited or acquired. Here are some possible ways to develop neuromuscular disorders:\n\n**Inherited Causes:**\n\n1. **Genetic mutations**: Many neuromuscular disorders are caused by genetic mutations that affect the genes responsible for muscle function and nerve communication. These mutations can be inherited from one's parents in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked pattern.\n2. **Family history**: Having a family history of neuromuscular disorders increases the risk of developing these conditions.\n\n**Acquired Causes:**\n\n1. **Autoimmune disorders**: Conditions like myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves or muscles.\n2. **Infections**: Certain infections, such as Lyme disease, can damage the nerves and lead to neuromuscular disorders.\n3. **Toxins and poisons**: Exposure to toxins like heavy metals, pesticides, or certain chemicals can damage the nervous system and muscles.\n4. **Trauma**: Physical trauma, such as spinal cord injuries or nerve damage, can lead to neuromuscular disorders.\n5. **Medications**: Certain medications, like antibiotics and statins, can cause muscle damage and lead to neuromuscular disorders.\n6. **Aging**: Age-related muscle wasting and weakness, known as sarcopenia, can be a natural process, but it can also be accelerated by various factors, such as lack of exercise, poor nutrition, and chronic diseases.\n\n**Examples of Neuromuscular Disorders:**\n\n1. Muscular dystrophy\n2. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\n3. Myasthenia gravis\n4. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\n5. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\n6. Spinal muscular atrophy\n\nIt's essential to note that many neuromuscular disorders are complex and multifactorial, and their causes may not be fully understood. If you're concerned about your risk or are experiencing symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and diagnosis.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nNeuromuscular Disorders (Summary): Summary Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves that control your voluntary muscles. Voluntary muscles are the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. Your nerve cells, also called neurons, send the messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die, communication between your nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result, your muscles weaken and waste away. The weakness can lead to twitching, cramps, aches and pains, and joint and movement problems. Sometimes it also affects heart function and your ability to breathe. Examples of neuromuscular disorders include - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Spinal muscular atrophy Many neuromuscular diseases are genetic, which means they run in families or there is a mutation in your genes. Sometimes, an immune system disorder can cause them. Most of them have no cure. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms, increase mobility and lengthen life.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Interpreting the numbers In the United States, cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. In Canada and many European countries, cholesterol levels are measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To interpret your test results, use these general guidelines. Children and cholesterol testing For most children, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends one cholesterol screening test between the ages of 9 and 11, and another cholesterol screening test between the ages of 17 and 21. Cholesterol testing is usually avoided between the ages of 12 and 16 because false-negative results are more likely within this age group. If your child has a family history of early-onset heart disease or a personal history of obesity or diabetes, your doctor may recommend earlier or more frequent cholesterol testing."

Interpreting the numbers In the United States, cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. In Canada and many European countries, cholesterol levels are measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To interpret your test results, use these general guidelines. Children and cholesterol testing For most children, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends one cholesterol screening test between the ages of 9 and 11, and another cholesterol screening test between the ages of 17 and 21. Cholesterol testing is usually avoided between the ages of 12 and 16 because false-negative results are more likely within this age group. If your child has a family history of early-onset heart disease or a personal history of obesity or diabetes, your doctor may recommend earlier or more frequent cholesterol testing.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Heart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program."

It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Asthma (Diagnosis): Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma\u2014that is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on. You may need to see an asthma specialist if: You need special tests to help diagnose asthma You've had a life-threatening asthma attack You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled You're thinking about getting allergy treatments Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to \"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\" Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. Diagnostic Tests Lung Function Test Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include: Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old. A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: One or both parents have asthma The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. Doctors also may use a 4\u20136 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds."

              "text": "Hemophilia: Espa\u00f1ol Hemophilia (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah) is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally. If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. Overview Hemophilia usually is inherited. \"Inherited\u201d means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. People born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrow\u2014a sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. The two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9). Rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \"Acquired\u201d means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. This article focuses on inherited hemophilia. Outlook Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. People who don't have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than\u00a0 1 percent. Hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year. Hemophilia A Classic hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency Hemophilia B Christmas disease Factor IX deficiency A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz). Chromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors. A male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \"hemophilia carrier\u201d and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding. Very rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females. Some males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren't carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child. Below are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 1 Each daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 2 Each daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia. The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Excessive Bleeding The extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is. Children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision. Bleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding). Signs of external bleeding may include: Bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth Nosebleeds for no obvious reason Heavy bleeding from a minor cut Bleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time Signs of internal bleeding may include: Blood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder) Blood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach) Large bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body) Bleeding in the Joints Bleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury. At first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend. Swelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint. Bleeding in the Brain Internal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include: Long-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or changes in behavior Sudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease. You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out: How long it takes for your blood to clot Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is. Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia. Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults. The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different. Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies. Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have \"preimplantation diagnosis\" to have children who don't have hemophilia. For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb. Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at home\u2014it only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include: Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working. These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 20\u201330 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 2\u20135 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to: Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: \u00a0 Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages: You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \"Living With Hemophilia\u201d). Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You? The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having. Mild hemophilia\u2014Replacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophilia\u2014You may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophilia\u2014You usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment. If you or your child has hemophilia, you can take steps to prevent bleeding problems. Thanks to improvements in treatment, a child who has hemophilia today is likely to live a normal lifespan. Hemophilia Treatment Centers The Federal Government funds a nationwide network of hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). These centers are an important resource for people who have hemophilia and their families. The medical experts at HTCs provide treatment, education, and support. They can teach you or your family members how to do home treatments. Center staff also can provide your doctor with information. People who get care at HTCs are less likely than those who get care elsewhere to have bleeding complications and hospitalizations. They're also more likely to have a better quality of life. This may be due to the centers' emphasis on bleeding prevention and the education and support provided to patients and their caregivers. More than 100 federally funded HTCs are located throughout the United States. Many HTCs are located at major university medical and research centers. The hemophilia teams at these centers include: Nurse coordinators Pediatricians (doctors who treat children) and adult and pediatric hematologists (doctors who specialize in blood disorders) Social workers (who can help with financial issues, transportation, mental health, and other issues) Physical therapists and orthopedists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the bones and joints) Dentists To find an HTC located near you, go to the directory of HTCs on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site. Many people who have hemophilia go to HTCs for annual checkups, even if it means traveling some distance to do so. At an HTC, you or your child may be able to take part in clinical research and benefit from the latest hemophilia research findings. The HTC team also will work with your local health care providers to help meet your needs or your child's needs. Ongoing Care If you have hemophilia, you can take steps to avoid complications. For example: Follow your treatment plan exactly as your doctor prescribes. Have regular checkups and vaccinations as recommended. Tell all of your health care providers\u2014such as your doctor, dentist, and pharmacist\u2014that you have hemophilia. You also may want to tell people like your employee health nurse, gym trainer, and sports coach about your condition. Have regular dental care. Dentists at the HTCs are experts in providing dental care for people who have hemophilia. If you see another dentist, tell him or her that you have hemophilia. The dentist can provide medicine that will reduce bleeding during dental work. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding in joints and other parts of the body. Know when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. For example, you'll need care if you have: - Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. - Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. - Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. It's a good idea to keep a record of all previous treatments. Be sure to take this information with you to medical appointments and to the hospital or emergency room. If Your Child Is Diagnosed With Hemophilia You may have emotional, financial, social, or other strains as you adjust to having a child who has hemophilia. Learn all you can about the disorder and get the support you need. Talk with doctors and other health care providers about treatment, prevention of bleeding, and what to do during an emergency. The care teams at HTCs can provide your child with treatment and help educate and support you. The social worker on the team can help with emotional issues, financial and transportation problems, and other concerns. Seek the many resources available through the Web, books, and other materials, including those provided by national and local hemophilia organizations. Look into support groups that offer a variety of activities for children who have hemophilia and for family members. Some groups offer summer camps for children who have hemophilia. Ask your doctor, nurse coordinator, or social worker about these groups and camps. Challenges will occur as your child grows and becomes more active. In addition to treatment and regular health and dental care, your child needs information about hemophilia that he or she can understand. Children who have hemophilia also need ongoing support, and they need to be reassured that the condition isn't their fault. Young children who have hemophilia need extra protection from things in the home and elsewhere that could cause injuries and bleeding: Protect toddlers with kneepads, elbow pads, and protective helmets. All children should wear safety helmets when riding tricycles or bicycles. Be sure to use the safety belts and straps in highchairs, car seats, and strollers to protect your child from falls. Remove furniture with sharp corners or pad them while your child is a toddler. Keep out of reach or locked away small and sharp objects and other items that could cause bleeding or harm. Check play equipment and outdoor play areas for possible hazards. You also should learn how to examine your child for and recognize signs of bleeding. Learn to prepare for bleeding episodes when they occur. Keep a cold pack in the freezer ready to use as directed or to take along with you to treat bumps and bruises. Popsicles work fine when there is minor bleeding in the mouth. You also might want to keep a bag ready to go with items you'll need if you must take your child to the emergency room or elsewhere. Be sure that anyone who is responsible for your child knows that he or she has hemophilia. Talk with your child's babysitters, daycare providers, teachers, other school staff, and coaches or leaders of afterschool activities about when to contact you or to call 9\u20131\u20131 for emergency care. Your child should wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace. If your child is injured, the ID will alert anyone caring for your child about his or her hemophilia. Physical Activity and Hemophilia Physical activity helps keep muscles flexible, strengthens joints, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Children and adults who have hemophilia should be physically active, but they may have limits on what they can do safely. People who have mild hemophilia can take part in many activities. Those who have severe hemophilia should avoid contact sports and other activities that are likely to lead to injuries that could cause bleeding. Examples of these activities include football, hockey, and wrestling. Physical therapists at HTCs can develop exercise programs tailored to your needs and teach you how to exercise safely. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about recommended types of physical activity and sports. In general, some safe physical activities are swimming, biking (wearing a helmet), walking, and golf. To prevent bleeding, you also may be able to take clotting factors prior to exercise or a sporting event. Medicine Precautions Some medicines increase the risk of bleeding, such as: Aspirin and other medicines that contain salicylates (sa-LIH-sil-ates) Ibuprofen, naproxen, and some other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Treatment at Home and When Traveling Home treatment with replacement therapy has many benefits. It lets you treat bleeding early, before complications are likely to develop. Home treatment also can prevent frequent trips to the doctor's office or hospital. This can give you more independence and control over your hemophilia. However, if you're treating yourself or your child with clotting factors at home, you should take some steps for safety: Follow instructions for storage, preparation, and use of clotting factors and treatment materials. Keep a record of all medical treatment. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding, infection, or an allergic reaction, and know the correct way to respond. Have someone with you when you treat yourself. Know when to call the doctor or 9\u20131\u20131. When you're traveling, be sure to take enough treatment supplies along. You also should carry a letter from your doctor describing your hemophilia and treatment. It's a good idea to find out in advance where to go for care when out of town. Cost Issues Clotting factors are very costly. Many health insurance companies will only pay for clotting factors on a case-by-case basis. It's important to know: What your insurance covers Whether your insurance has a limit on the dollar amount it will cover and what that amount is Whether restrictions or waiting periods apply As children grow, it's important to learn about available options for insurance. Look into what kinds of health insurance are offered when seeking a job."

If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. Overview Hemophilia usually is inherited. \"Inherited\u201d means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. People born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrow\u2014a sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. The two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9). Rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \"Acquired\u201d means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. This article focuses on inherited hemophilia. Outlook Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. People who don't have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than\u00a0 1 percent. Hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year. Hemophilia A Classic hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency Hemophilia B Christmas disease Factor IX deficiency A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz). Chromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors. A male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \"hemophilia carrier\u201d and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding. Very rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females. Some males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren't carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child. Below are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 1 Each daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 2 Each daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia. The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Excessive Bleeding The extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is. Children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision. Bleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding). Signs of external bleeding may include: Bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth Nosebleeds for no obvious reason Heavy bleeding from a minor cut Bleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time Signs of internal bleeding may include: Blood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder) Blood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach) Large bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body) Bleeding in the Joints Bleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury. At first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend. Swelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint. Bleeding in the Brain Internal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include: Long-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or changes in behavior Sudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease. You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out: How long it takes for your blood to clot Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is. Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia. Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults. The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different. Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies. Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have \"preimplantation diagnosis\" to have children who don't have hemophilia. For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb. Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at home\u2014it only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include: Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working. These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 20\u201330 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 2\u20135 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to: Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: \u00a0 Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages: You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \"Living With Hemophilia\u201d). Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You? The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having. Mild hemophilia\u2014Replacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophilia\u2014You may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophilia\u2014You usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment. If you or your child has hemophilia, you can take steps to prevent bleeding problems. Thanks to improvements in treatment, a child who has hemophilia today is likely to live a normal lifespan. Hemophilia Treatment Centers The Federal Government funds a nationwide network of hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). These centers are an important resource for people who have hemophilia and their families. The medical experts at HTCs provide treatment, education, and support. They can teach you or your family members how to do home treatments. Center staff also can provide your doctor with information. People who get care at HTCs are less likely than those who get care elsewhere to have bleeding complications and hospitalizations. They're also more likely to have a better quality of life. This may be due to the centers' emphasis on bleeding prevention and the education and support provided to patients and their caregivers. More than 100 federally funded HTCs are located throughout the United States. Many HTCs are located at major university medical and research centers. The hemophilia teams at these centers include: Nurse coordinators Pediatricians (doctors who treat children) and adult and pediatric hematologists (doctors who specialize in blood disorders) Social workers (who can help with financial issues, transportation, mental health, and other issues) Physical therapists and orthopedists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the bones and joints) Dentists To find an HTC located near you, go to the directory of HTCs on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site. Many people who have hemophilia go to HTCs for annual checkups, even if it means traveling some distance to do so. At an HTC, you or your child may be able to take part in clinical research and benefit from the latest hemophilia research findings. The HTC team also will work with your local health care providers to help meet your needs or your child's needs. Ongoing Care If you have hemophilia, you can take steps to avoid complications. For example: Follow your treatment plan exactly as your doctor prescribes. Have regular checkups and vaccinations as recommended. Tell all of your health care providers\u2014such as your doctor, dentist, and pharmacist\u2014that you have hemophilia. You also may want to tell people like your employee health nurse, gym trainer, and sports coach about your condition. Have regular dental care. Dentists at the HTCs are experts in providing dental care for people who have hemophilia. If you see another dentist, tell him or her that you have hemophilia. The dentist can provide medicine that will reduce bleeding during dental work. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding in joints and other parts of the body. Know when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. For example, you'll need care if you have: - Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. - Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. - Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. It's a good idea to keep a record of all previous treatments. Be sure to take this information with you to medical appointments and to the hospital or emergency room. If Your Child Is Diagnosed With Hemophilia You may have emotional, financial, social, or other strains as you adjust to having a child who has hemophilia. Learn all you can about the disorder and get the support you need. Talk with doctors and other health care providers about treatment, prevention of bleeding, and what to do during an emergency. The care teams at HTCs can provide your child with treatment and help educate and support you. The social worker on the team can help with emotional issues, financial and transportation problems, and other concerns. Seek the many resources available through the Web, books, and other materials, including those provided by national and local hemophilia organizations. Look into support groups that offer a variety of activities for children who have hemophilia and for family members. Some groups offer summer camps for children who have hemophilia. Ask your doctor, nurse coordinator, or social worker about these groups and camps. Challenges will occur as your child grows and becomes more active. In addition to treatment and regular health and dental care, your child needs information about hemophilia that he or she can understand. Children who have hemophilia also need ongoing support, and they need to be reassured that the condition isn't their fault. Young children who have hemophilia need extra protection from things in the home and elsewhere that could cause injuries and bleeding: Protect toddlers with kneepads, elbow pads, and protective helmets. All children should wear safety helmets when riding tricycles or bicycles. Be sure to use the safety belts and straps in highchairs, car seats, and strollers to protect your child from falls. Remove furniture with sharp corners or pad them while your child is a toddler. Keep out of reach or locked away small and sharp objects and other items that could cause bleeding or harm. Check play equipment and outdoor play areas for possible hazards. You also should learn how to examine your child for and recognize signs of bleeding. Learn to prepare for bleeding episodes when they occur. Keep a cold pack in the freezer ready to use as directed or to take along with you to treat bumps and bruises. Popsicles work fine when there is minor bleeding in the mouth. You also might want to keep a bag ready to go with items you'll need if you must take your child to the emergency room or elsewhere. Be sure that anyone who is responsible for your child knows that he or she has hemophilia. Talk with your child's babysitters, daycare providers, teachers, other school staff, and coaches or leaders of afterschool activities about when to contact you or to call 9\u20131\u20131 for emergency care. Your child should wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace. If your child is injured, the ID will alert anyone caring for your child about his or her hemophilia. Physical Activity and Hemophilia Physical activity helps keep muscles flexible, strengthens joints, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Children and adults who have hemophilia should be physically active, but they may have limits on what they can do safely. People who have mild hemophilia can take part in many activities. Those who have severe hemophilia should avoid contact sports and other activities that are likely to lead to injuries that could cause bleeding. Examples of these activities include football, hockey, and wrestling. Physical therapists at HTCs can develop exercise programs tailored to your needs and teach you how to exercise safely. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about recommended types of physical activity and sports. In general, some safe physical activities are swimming, biking (wearing a helmet), walking, and golf. To prevent bleeding, you also may be able to take clotting factors prior to exercise or a sporting event. Medicine Precautions Some medicines increase the risk of bleeding, such as: Aspirin and other medicines that contain salicylates (sa-LIH-sil-ates) Ibuprofen, naproxen, and some other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Treatment at Home and When Traveling Home treatment with replacement therapy has many benefits. It lets you treat bleeding early, before complications are likely to develop. Home treatment also can prevent frequent trips to the doctor's office or hospital. This can give you more independence and control over your hemophilia. However, if you're treating yourself or your child with clotting factors at home, you should take some steps for safety: Follow instructions for storage, preparation, and use of clotting factors and treatment materials. Keep a record of all medical treatment. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding, infection, or an allergic reaction, and know the correct way to respond. Have someone with you when you treat yourself. Know when to call the doctor or 9\u20131\u20131. When you're traveling, be sure to take enough treatment supplies along. You also should carry a letter from your doctor describing your hemophilia and treatment. It's a good idea to find out in advance where to go for care when out of town. Cost Issues Clotting factors are very costly. Many health insurance companies will only pay for clotting factors on a case-by-case basis. It's important to know: What your insurance covers Whether your insurance has a limit on the dollar amount it will cover and what that amount is Whether restrictions or waiting periods apply As children grow, it's important to learn about available options for insurance. Look into what kinds of health insurance are offered when seeking a job.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

While the exact cause of CHD is often unknown, research suggests that genetics play a significant role in the development of CHD. Here's how CHD can be passed down:\n\n1. **Genetic inheritance**: Some congenital heart defects can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern. This means that if one parent has a CHD, their child has a higher risk of developing a CHD. The risk varies depending on the type of CHD and the family history.\n2. **Family history**: If there is a family history of CHD, the risk of a child developing a CHD increases. If one sibling has a CHD, the risk of another sibling having a CHD is about 2-5%. If two siblings have a CHD, the risk increases to 10-20%.\n3. **Genetic syndromes**: Certain genetic syndromes, such as Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Turner syndrome, increase the risk of CHD. These syndromes are usually caused by chromosomal abnormalities or genetic mutations.\n4. **Single gene mutations**: Some CHDs are caused by mutations in single genes. For example, mutations in the NKX2.5 gene can cause atrial septal defects (ASDs) and other heart defects.\n\nCommon genetic patterns associated with CHD:\n\n* **Autosomal dominant**: A single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. Examples include:\n\t+ Marfan syndrome\n\t+ Loeys-Dietz syndrome\n* **Autosomal recessive**: Two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are needed to cause the condition. Examples include:\n\t+ Certain types of cardiomyopathy\n\n**Environmental factors**: While genetics play a significant role in CHD, environmental factors can also contribute to the development of CHD. These include:\n\n* **Maternal diabetes**: Women with diabetes during pregnancy are at higher risk of having a child with a CHD.\n* **Maternal obesity**: Obesity during pregnancy may increase the risk of CHD in offspring.\n* **Exposure to certain medications or toxins**: Exposure to certain medications, such as isotretinoin (Accutane), or toxins, like lithium, during pregnancy may increase the risk of CHD.\n\nIt's essential to note that most cases of CHD occur in families without a known history of heart defects. If you have concerns about CHD or a family history of CHD, consult with a healthcare provider or a genetic counselor for personalized guidance.",

              "text": "Spinal and epidural anesthesia: Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine. The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist. First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic. You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly. For an epidural: - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space. - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth. - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure. For a spinal: - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed. - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures. Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). People usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk. Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures. Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when: - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine. - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet. - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure. - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications: - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma) - Difficulty urinating - Drop in blood pressure - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess) - Nerve damage - Seizures (this is rare) - Severe headache Tell your health care provider: - If you are or could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the procedure: - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before. - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinners. - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure. - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic. - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. On the day of the procedure: - Follow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking. - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure. - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. - Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours. This is to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

Here are some possible ways an epidural can be harmful:\n\n1. **Headaches**: After an epidural, some women may experience a severe headache due to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the puncture site. This headache can be debilitating and may last for several days.\n2. **Numbness or tingling**: Epidurals can cause numbness or tingling in the legs, back, or abdomen, which can last for several hours or even days after delivery.\n3. **Increased risk of instrumental delivery**: Women who receive an epidural may be more likely to require instrumental delivery (forceps or vacuum extraction) due to decreased sensation and mobility.\n4. **Prolonged labor**: Epidurals can slow down labor, leading to a longer labor process and potentially increasing the risk of interventions like oxytocin augmentation.\n5. **Fetal distress**: In some cases, epidurals can cause a decrease in fetal heart rate variability, which may indicate fetal distress.\n6. **Allergic reactions**: Some women may be allergic to the medications used in an epidural, which can cause an allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis.\n7. **Blood clots**: Epidurals can increase the risk of blood clots, particularly if the woman has a history of blood clots or is immobile for an extended period.\n8. **Nerve damage**: Although rare, epidurals can cause nerve damage, leading to numbness, tingling, or chronic pain in the back or legs.\n9. **Spinal hematoma**: A rare but serious complication of epidural anesthesia is a spinal hematoma, which is a collection of blood in the spinal canal that can compress the spinal cord.\n10. **Respiratory problems**: Epidurals can cause respiratory problems, such as respiratory depression, in the mother and potentially affect the baby's breathing.\n\nIt's essential to note that epidurals are generally considered safe when administered by a trained anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) in a hospital setting. The risks and benefits of an epidural should be discussed with a healthcare provider to make an informed decision.\n\nWould you like me to add any additional information?\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nSpinal and epidural anesthesia: Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine. The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist. First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic. You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly. For an epidural: - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space. - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth. - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure. For a spinal: - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed. - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures. Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). People usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk. Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures. Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when: - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine. - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet. - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure. - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications: - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma) - Difficulty urinating - Drop in blood pressure - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess) - Nerve damage - Seizures (this is rare) - Severe headache Tell your health care provider: - If you are or could be pregnant - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before the procedure: - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before. - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinners. - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure. - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic. - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. On the day of the procedure: - Follow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking. - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure. - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. - Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours. This is to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

              "text": "How should Ibuprofen be used and what is the dosage?: Prescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen. If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children. Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child. Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops. The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water. Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child's pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days. Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition."

However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n* The therapeutic dose of oxazepam is typically 10-30 mg taken 2-3 times a day.\n* The maximum recommended daily dose is around 120-150 mg.\n* Taking more than 200-300 mg of oxazepam at once can lead to an overdose.\n* A dose of 500-1000 mg or more can be potentially life-threatening.\n\nSigns of an oxazepam overdose may include:\n* Drowsiness or coma\n* Confusion\n* Slurred speech\n* Unsteady gait\n* Slow or shallow breathing\n* Blue-tinged lips or skin\n* Seizures\n\nIf you suspect someone has overdosed on oxazepam, it's essential to call emergency services immediately. Treatment typically involves supportive care, such as monitoring vital signs and providing respiratory support, as well as administration of a benzodiazepine antidote, if available.\n\nKeep in mind that mixing oxazepam with other substances, such as alcohol or opioids, can significantly increase the risk of an overdose. If you're taking oxazepam or any other medication, follow the recommended dosage and consult with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat is Oxazepam overdose?: Oxazepam is a medicine used to treat anxiety and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. It belongs to the class of medicines known as benzodiazepines. Oxazepam overdose occurs when someone accidentally or intentionally takes too much of this medicine. Benzodiazepines are the most common prescription drugs used in suicide attempts. This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Nicotine dependence: Nicotine dependence -- also called tobacco dependence -- is an addiction to tobacco products caused by the drug nicotine. Nicotine dependence means you can't stop using the substance, even though it's causing you harm. Nicotine produces physical and mood-altering effects in your brain that are temporarily pleasing. These effects make you want to use tobacco and lead to dependence. At the same time, stopping tobacco use causes withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and anxiety. While it's the nicotine in tobacco that causes nicotine dependence, the toxic effects of tobacco result from other substances in tobacco. Smokers have much higher rates of heart disease, stroke and cancer than nonsmokers do. Regardless of how long you've smoked, stopping smoking can improve your health. Many effective treatments for nicotine dependence are available to help you manage withdrawal and stop smoking for good. Ask your doctor for help. For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: - You can't stop smoking. You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. - You experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. - You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. - You give up social or recreational activities in order to smoke. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with certain family members or friends because you can't smoke in these locations or situations. You're not alone if you've tried to stop smoking but haven't been able to stop for good. Most smokers make many attempts to stop smoking before they achieve stable, long-term abstinence from smoking. You're more likely to stop for good if you follow a treatment plan that addresses both the physical and the behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. Using medications and working with a counselor specially trained to help people stop smoking (a tobacco treatment specialist) will significantly boost your chances of success. Ask your doctor, counselor or therapist to help you develop a treatment plan that works for you or to advise you on where to get help to stop smoking. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine is very addictive when delivered by inhaling tobacco smoke into the lungs, which quickly releases nicotine into the blood allowing it to get into the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help regulate mood and behavior. Dopamine, one of these neurotransmitters, is released in the \"reward center\" of the brain and causes improved mood and feelings of pleasure. Experiencing these effects from nicotine is what makes tobacco so addictive. Nicotine dependence involves behavioral (routines, habits, feelings) as well as physical factors. These behavioral associations with smoking may act as triggers - situations or feelings that activate a craving for tobacco, even if you have not smoked for some time. Behaviors and cues that you may associate with smoking include: - Certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, with morning coffee or during breaks at work - After a meal - Drinking alcohol - Certain places or friends - Talking on the phone - Stressful situations or when you're feeling down - Sight or smell of a burning cigarette - Driving your car To overcome your dependence on tobacco, you need to become aware of your triggers and develop a plan to deal with the behaviors and routines that you associate with smoking. Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who will use tobacco include: - Genetics. The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited - genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain's nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes. - Home and peer influence. Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke also are more likely to try cigarettes. Evidence suggests that smoking shown in movies and on the Internet can encourage young people to smoke. - Age. Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you'll become a heavy smoker as an adult. - Depression or other mental illness. Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers. - Substance use. People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 known cancer-causing chemicals and thousands of other harmful substances. Even \"all natural\" or herbal cigarettes have chemicals that are harmful to your health. Smoking harms almost every organ of your body and impairs your body's immune system. About half of all regular smokers will die of a disease caused by tobacco. Women smokers are now at equal risk to men smokers of dying from lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease caused by using tobacco. The negative health effects include: - Lung cancer and other lung diseases. Smoking causes nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancer cases. In addition, smoking causes other lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse. - Other cancers. Smoking is a major cause of cancers of the esophagus, larynx, throat (pharynx) and mouth and is related to cancers of the bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix, and some leukemias. Overall, smoking causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths. - Heart and circulatory system problems. Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attack and stroke. Even smoking just one to four cigarettes daily increases your risk of heart disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition. However, stopping smoking reduces your risk of having a heart attack by 50 percent in the first year. - Diabetes. Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for the development of type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems. - Eye problems. Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration. - Infertility and impotence. Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men. - Pregnancy and newborn complications. Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, lower birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in their newborns. - Cold, flu and other illnesses. Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. - Weakened senses. Smoking deadens your senses of taste and smell, so food isn't as appetizing. - Teeth and gum disease. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammation of the gum (gingivitis) and a serious gum infection that can destroy the support system for teeth (periodontitis). - Physical appearance. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can change the structure of your skin, causing premature aging and wrinkles. Smoking also yellows your teeth, fingers and fingernails. - Risks to your family. Nonsmoking spouses and partners of smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don't live with a smoker. If you smoke, your children will be more prone to SIDS, worsening asthma, ear infections and colds. Your doctor may ask you questions or have you complete a questionnaire to get a sense of how dependent you are on nicotine. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after awakening, the more dependent you are. Knowing your degree of dependence will help your doctor determine the best treatment plan for you. Like most smokers, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt - especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to stop if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination. Medications Many treatments, including nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, have been approved as safe and effective in treating nicotine dependence. Using more than one medication may help you get better results. For example, combining a longer acting medication with a short-acting nicotine replacement product may be beneficial. Talk to your health care provider about the right treatment for you. If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, you smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, or you're under age 18, talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter nicotine replacement products. Nicotine replacement therapy Nicotine replacement therapy gives you nicotine without tobacco and the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Nicotine replacement products help relieve withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The best time to start using nicotine replacement medication is on the date you've set to stop smoking. Some smokers start earlier in order to reduce smoking on their way to stopping altogether. The following nicotine replacement products are available over-the-counter: - Nicotine patch (NicoDerm CQ, Habitrol, others). The patch delivers nicotine through your skin and into your bloodstream. You wear a new patch each day. You typically use the patch for eight weeks or longer. If you haven't been able to stop smoking completely after two weeks of wearing the patch, ask your doctor about adjusting the dose or adding another nicotine replacement product. Common side effects include skin irritation, insomnia and vivid dreams. - Nicotine gum (Nicorette, others). This gum delivers nicotine to your blood through the lining of your mouth. Nicotine gum is often recommended to curb cravings. Chew the gum for a few times until you feel a mild tingling or peppery taste, then park the gum between your cheek and gumline for several minutes. This chewing and parking allows nicotine to be gradually absorbed in your bloodstream. Mouth irritation is a common side effect. Other side effects are often a result of overly vigorous chewing that releases nicotine too quickly. These include heartburn, nausea and hiccups. - Nicotine lozenge (Commit, Nicorette mini lozenge, others). This lozenge dissolves in your mouth and, like nicotine gum, delivers nicotine through the lining of your mouth. Place the lozenge in your mouth between your gumline and cheek or under your tongue and allow it to dissolve. You'll start with one lozenge every one to two hours and gradually increase the time between lozenges. Avoid drinking anything right before, while using or right after the lozenge. Side effects include mouth irritation as well as nicotine-related effects such as heartburn, nausea and hiccups. These nicotine replacement products are available by prescription: - Nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS). The nicotine in this product, sprayed directly into each nostril, is absorbed through your nasal membranes into your blood vessels. The nasal spray delivers nicotine a bit quicker than gum, lozenges or the patch, but not as rapidly as smoking a cigarette. It's usually prescribed for three-month periods for up to six months. Nasal and throat irritation, runny nose, sneezing and coughing are common side effects. - Nicotine inhaler (Nicotrol). This device is shaped something like a cigarette holder. You puff on it, and it delivers nicotine vapor into your mouth. You absorb the nicotine through the lining in your mouth, where it then enters your bloodstream. Common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and occasional coughing. Non-nicotine medications Medications that don't contain nicotine and are available by prescription include: - Bupropion (Zyban). The antidepressant drug bupropion increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, brain chemicals that are also boosted by nicotine. Typically your doctor will advise you to start bupropion one week before you stop smoking. Bupropion has the advantage of helping to minimize weight gain after you quit smoking. Common side effects include insomnia, agitation, headache and dry mouth. If you have a history of seizures or serious head trauma, such as a skull fracture, you shouldn't take this drug. - Varenicline (Chantix). This medication acts on the brain's nicotine receptors, decreasing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the feelings of pleasure you get from smoking. Typically your doctor will advise you to start varenicline one week before you stop smoking. Common side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia and vivid dreams. Rarely, varenicline has been associated with serious psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. - Nortriptyline (Pamelor). This medication may be prescribed if other medications haven't helped. This tricyclic antidepressant acts by increasing the levels of the brain neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Common side effects may include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation. Counseling, support groups and other programs Combining medications with behavioral counseling provides the best chance for establishing long-term smoking abstinence. Medications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms including tobacco craving, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to avoid tobacco over the long run. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be. Several types of counseling and support can help with stopping smoking: - Telephone counseling. No matter where you live, you can take advantage of phone counseling to help you give up tobacco. Every state in the U.S. has a telephone quit line, and some have more than one. To find the options in your state, call 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669). - Individual or group counseling program. Your doctor may recommend local support groups or a treatment program where counseling is provided by a tobacco treatment specialist. Counseling helps you learn techniques for preparing to stop smoking and provides support for you during the process. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs or have tobacco treatment specialists who are certified to provide treatment for nicotine dependence. Nicotine Anonymous groups are available in many locations to provide support for smokers trying to quit. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs - the most intensive treatment available. - Internet-based programs. Several websites offer support and strategies for people who want to stop smoking. BecomeAnEX is free and provides information and techniques as well as blogs, community forums, ask the expert and many other features. Text messaging services, including personalized reminders about a quit-smoking plan, also may prove helpful. Methods to avoid It's not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for cigarette smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe. Even products that deliver nicotine without tobacco are risky. Stick with proven stop-smoking aids and steer clear of the following products: - Dissolvable tobacco products. Tobacco pouches, lozenges, strips or other products contain small amounts of tobacco and nicotine you hold or dissolve in your mouth. There is no evidence they will help you stop smoking and little is known about their health effects. - E-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices that heat liquid containing nicotine into a vapor to be inhaled. Because these products are new, there isn't much data about possible safety risks. Studies of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation have shown mixed results. For these reasons, e-cigarettes aren't recommended for people trying to quit smoking. - Flavored cigarettes. Clove cigarettes (kreteks) and flavored cigarettes (bidis) carry the same health risks as smoking regular cigarettes and can cause additional health problems. Although they're banned in the United States, flavored cigarettes are available in other countries. - Hookahs (narghiles). These are water pipes that burn tobacco, and the smoke is inhaled through a hose. They are not safer than cigarettes. The water does not filter out toxins in the smoke, and the water and pipe have a risk of transmitting infections. - Nicotine lollipops and balms. Products containing nicotine salicylate are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and they pose a risk for accidental use by children. - Pipes and cigars. These products have similar, though less frequent, health risks as cigarettes, and they are not a safe alternative. - Smokeless tobacco and snuff (snus). These products contain nicotine in amounts similar to cigarettes and increase your risk of mouth and throat cancer, tooth and gum diseases, and other health problems. It's important to have a plan for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms are usually the most intense during the first week after you stop smoking. They may continue for several weeks, with declining intensity. Although most nicotine withdrawal symptoms pass within a month, you may occasionally experience a strong urge or craving to smoke months after stopping. Triggers or cues that were associated with your smoking can provoke these urges or cravings. Here's what you can do to help manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Regular physical activity has been found to reduce withdrawal symptoms and help people stop smoking. Exercise also helps avoid potential weight gain often associated with stopping. - Wait out cravings. Cravings or urges usually last less than five minutes. Wash the dishes, go for a walk or have a healthy snack, such as carrots, an apple or sunflower seeds, which will keep your mouth busy. Do something that keeps your hands busy, and before you know it, the urge will have passed. This is why you want to get rid of tobacco supplies when you decide to quit. You don't want to have any on hand when a craving hits. - Identify rationalizations. If you find yourself thinking, \"I'll just smoke one to get through this tough time\" or \"Just one won't hurt,\" recognize it as a message that can derail your plan. Review your reasons for quitting, and replace that thought with something positive to support your stopping. - Talk to a support person. If you're feeling anxious or depressed or need encouragement, a support person can help you get through a difficult craving. - Avoid high-risk situations. Know your triggers, and stay away from people, places and situations that tempt you to smoke. - Eat regular, healthy meals. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink more water. Many products claim to be smoking-cessation aids. Many also claim to be \"natural.\" Just remember that \"natural\" doesn't necessarily mean \"safe.\" Talk with your doctor before trying any alternative medicine treatments. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture involves stimulating points on the body, typically with thin, solid, metallic needles. Several studies have been conducted on the effects of acupuncture or acupressure for smoking cessation, but there's no definitive evidence that it works. - Herbs and supplements. A few studies have been conducted on the dietary supplements SAMe, silver acetate and St. John's wort for the treatment of tobacco dependence, but there is no current evidence that any natural product improves smoking cessation rates. - Hypnosis. Although no evidence supports the use of hypnosis - also called hypnotherapy - in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful. If you choose to pursue hypnosis, talk to your doctor about finding a reputable therapist. - Meditation. Although no evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful to reduce symptoms of anxiety."

Here's how it affects the brain:\n\n**Initial Effects:**\n\n1. **Rapid Absorption**: When nicotine is inhaled or ingested, it's quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and reaches the brain within 10-15 seconds.\n2. **Binding to Nicotine Receptors**: Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are located throughout the brain, particularly in areas involved in reward, motivation, and learning.\n\n**Short-Term Effects:**\n\n1. **Dopamine Release**: Nicotine triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, reward, and motivation. This surge in dopamine reinforces the behavior of smoking or using nicotine products.\n2. **Stimulation and Relaxation**: Nicotine can produce feelings of relaxation, reduced stress, and increased alertness.\n\n**Long-Term Effects:**\n\n1. **Dependence and Addiction**: Repeated exposure to nicotine can lead to physical dependence and addiction. The brain adapts to the constant presence of nicotine by changing the number and sensitivity of nAChRs.\n2. **Withdrawal Symptoms**: When nicotine use is stopped or reduced, withdrawal symptoms occur, such as irritability, anxiety, and cravings, as the brain readjusts to the absence of nicotine.\n3. **Changes in Brain Chemistry**: Chronic nicotine use can alter the brain's chemistry, including changes in the levels and activity of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.\n\n**Brain Regions Affected:**\n\n1. **Reward System**: Nicotine activates the brain's reward system, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, which are involved in motivation, pleasure, and learning.\n2. **Prefrontal Cortex**: Nicotine affects the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive function, decision-making, and impulse control.\n3. **Hippocampus and Amygdala**: Nicotine also impacts the hippocampus and amygdala, which are involved in memory and emotional processing.\n\n**Health Consequences:**\n\n1. **Increased Risk of Smoking-Related Diseases**: Nicotine addiction increases the risk of smoking-related diseases, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n2. **Cognitive Impairment**: Chronic nicotine use can impair cognitive function, particularly in adolescents and young adults.\n3. **Mental Health Concerns**: Nicotine use is linked to an increased risk of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.\n\nUnderstanding how nicotine affects the brain can help individuals make informed decisions about nicotine use and encourage those who use nicotine products to seek help for addiction.",

Nicotine dependence means you can't stop using the substance, even though it's causing you harm. Nicotine produces physical and mood-altering effects in your brain that are temporarily pleasing. These effects make you want to use tobacco and lead to dependence. At the same time, stopping tobacco use causes withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and anxiety. While it's the nicotine in tobacco that causes nicotine dependence, the toxic effects of tobacco result from other substances in tobacco. Smokers have much higher rates of heart disease, stroke and cancer than nonsmokers do. Regardless of how long you've smoked, stopping smoking can improve your health. Many effective treatments for nicotine dependence are available to help you manage withdrawal and stop smoking for good. Ask your doctor for help. For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: - You can't stop smoking. You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. - You experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. - You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. - You give up social or recreational activities in order to smoke. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with certain family members or friends because you can't smoke in these locations or situations. You're not alone if you've tried to stop smoking but haven't been able to stop for good. Most smokers make many attempts to stop smoking before they achieve stable, long-term abstinence from smoking. You're more likely to stop for good if you follow a treatment plan that addresses both the physical and the behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. Using medications and working with a counselor specially trained to help people stop smoking (a tobacco treatment specialist) will significantly boost your chances of success. Ask your doctor, counselor or therapist to help you develop a treatment plan that works for you or to advise you on where to get help to stop smoking. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine is very addictive when delivered by inhaling tobacco smoke into the lungs, which quickly releases nicotine into the blood allowing it to get into the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help regulate mood and behavior. Dopamine, one of these neurotransmitters, is released in the \"reward center\" of the brain and causes improved mood and feelings of pleasure. Experiencing these effects from nicotine is what makes tobacco so addictive. Nicotine dependence involves behavioral (routines, habits, feelings) as well as physical factors. These behavioral associations with smoking may act as triggers - situations or feelings that activate a craving for tobacco, even if you have not smoked for some time. Behaviors and cues that you may associate with smoking include: - Certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, with morning coffee or during breaks at work - After a meal - Drinking alcohol - Certain places or friends - Talking on the phone - Stressful situations or when you're feeling down - Sight or smell of a burning cigarette - Driving your car To overcome your dependence on tobacco, you need to become aware of your triggers and develop a plan to deal with the behaviors and routines that you associate with smoking. Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who will use tobacco include: - Genetics. The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited - genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain's nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes. - Home and peer influence. Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke also are more likely to try cigarettes. Evidence suggests that smoking shown in movies and on the Internet can encourage young people to smoke. - Age. Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you'll become a heavy smoker as an adult. - Depression or other mental illness. Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers. - Substance use. People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 known cancer-causing chemicals and thousands of other harmful substances. Even \"all natural\" or herbal cigarettes have chemicals that are harmful to your health. Smoking harms almost every organ of your body and impairs your body's immune system. About half of all regular smokers will die of a disease caused by tobacco. Women smokers are now at equal risk to men smokers of dying from lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease caused by using tobacco. The negative health effects include: - Lung cancer and other lung diseases. Smoking causes nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancer cases. In addition, smoking causes other lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse. - Other cancers. Smoking is a major cause of cancers of the esophagus, larynx, throat (pharynx) and mouth and is related to cancers of the bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix, and some leukemias. Overall, smoking causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths. - Heart and circulatory system problems. Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attack and stroke. Even smoking just one to four cigarettes daily increases your risk of heart disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition. However, stopping smoking reduces your risk of having a heart attack by 50 percent in the first year. - Diabetes. Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for the development of type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems. - Eye problems. Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration. - Infertility and impotence. Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men. - Pregnancy and newborn complications. Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, lower birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in their newborns. - Cold, flu and other illnesses. Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, flu and bronchitis. - Weakened senses. Smoking deadens your senses of taste and smell, so food isn't as appetizing. - Teeth and gum disease. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammation of the gum (gingivitis) and a serious gum infection that can destroy the support system for teeth (periodontitis). - Physical appearance. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can change the structure of your skin, causing premature aging and wrinkles. Smoking also yellows your teeth, fingers and fingernails. - Risks to your family. Nonsmoking spouses and partners of smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don't live with a smoker. If you smoke, your children will be more prone to SIDS, worsening asthma, ear infections and colds. Your doctor may ask you questions or have you complete a questionnaire to get a sense of how dependent you are on nicotine. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after awakening, the more dependent you are. Knowing your degree of dependence will help your doctor determine the best treatment plan for you. Like most smokers, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt - especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to stop if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination. Medications Many treatments, including nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, have been approved as safe and effective in treating nicotine dependence. Using more than one medication may help you get better results. For example, combining a longer acting medication with a short-acting nicotine replacement product may be beneficial. Talk to your health care provider about the right treatment for you. If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, you smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, or you're under age 18, talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter nicotine replacement products. Nicotine replacement therapy Nicotine replacement therapy gives you nicotine without tobacco and the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Nicotine replacement products help relieve withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The best time to start using nicotine replacement medication is on the date you've set to stop smoking. Some smokers start earlier in order to reduce smoking on their way to stopping altogether. The following nicotine replacement products are available over-the-counter: - Nicotine patch (NicoDerm CQ, Habitrol, others). The patch delivers nicotine through your skin and into your bloodstream. You wear a new patch each day. You typically use the patch for eight weeks or longer. If you haven't been able to stop smoking completely after two weeks of wearing the patch, ask your doctor about adjusting the dose or adding another nicotine replacement product. Common side effects include skin irritation, insomnia and vivid dreams. - Nicotine gum (Nicorette, others). This gum delivers nicotine to your blood through the lining of your mouth. Nicotine gum is often recommended to curb cravings. Chew the gum for a few times until you feel a mild tingling or peppery taste, then park the gum between your cheek and gumline for several minutes. This chewing and parking allows nicotine to be gradually absorbed in your bloodstream. Mouth irritation is a common side effect. Other side effects are often a result of overly vigorous chewing that releases nicotine too quickly. These include heartburn, nausea and hiccups. - Nicotine lozenge (Commit, Nicorette mini lozenge, others). This lozenge dissolves in your mouth and, like nicotine gum, delivers nicotine through the lining of your mouth. Place the lozenge in your mouth between your gumline and cheek or under your tongue and allow it to dissolve. You'll start with one lozenge every one to two hours and gradually increase the time between lozenges. Avoid drinking anything right before, while using or right after the lozenge. Side effects include mouth irritation as well as nicotine-related effects such as heartburn, nausea and hiccups. These nicotine replacement products are available by prescription: - Nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS). The nicotine in this product, sprayed directly into each nostril, is absorbed through your nasal membranes into your blood vessels. The nasal spray delivers nicotine a bit quicker than gum, lozenges or the patch, but not as rapidly as smoking a cigarette. It's usually prescribed for three-month periods for up to six months. Nasal and throat irritation, runny nose, sneezing and coughing are common side effects. - Nicotine inhaler (Nicotrol). This device is shaped something like a cigarette holder. You puff on it, and it delivers nicotine vapor into your mouth. You absorb the nicotine through the lining in your mouth, where it then enters your bloodstream. Common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and occasional coughing. Non-nicotine medications Medications that don't contain nicotine and are available by prescription include: - Bupropion (Zyban). The antidepressant drug bupropion increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, brain chemicals that are also boosted by nicotine. Typically your doctor will advise you to start bupropion one week before you stop smoking. Bupropion has the advantage of helping to minimize weight gain after you quit smoking. Common side effects include insomnia, agitation, headache and dry mouth. If you have a history of seizures or serious head trauma, such as a skull fracture, you shouldn't take this drug. - Varenicline (Chantix). This medication acts on the brain's nicotine receptors, decreasing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the feelings of pleasure you get from smoking. Typically your doctor will advise you to start varenicline one week before you stop smoking. Common side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia and vivid dreams. Rarely, varenicline has been associated with serious psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. - Nortriptyline (Pamelor). This medication may be prescribed if other medications haven't helped. This tricyclic antidepressant acts by increasing the levels of the brain neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Common side effects may include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation. Counseling, support groups and other programs Combining medications with behavioral counseling provides the best chance for establishing long-term smoking abstinence. Medications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms including tobacco craving, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to avoid tobacco over the long run. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be. Several types of counseling and support can help with stopping smoking: - Telephone counseling. No matter where you live, you can take advantage of phone counseling to help you give up tobacco. Every state in the U.S. has a telephone quit line, and some have more than one. To find the options in your state, call 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669). - Individual or group counseling program. Your doctor may recommend local support groups or a treatment program where counseling is provided by a tobacco treatment specialist. Counseling helps you learn techniques for preparing to stop smoking and provides support for you during the process. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs or have tobacco treatment specialists who are certified to provide treatment for nicotine dependence. Nicotine Anonymous groups are available in many locations to provide support for smokers trying to quit. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs - the most intensive treatment available. - Internet-based programs. Several websites offer support and strategies for people who want to stop smoking. BecomeAnEX is free and provides information and techniques as well as blogs, community forums, ask the expert and many other features. Text messaging services, including personalized reminders about a quit-smoking plan, also may prove helpful. Methods to avoid It's not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for cigarette smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe. Even products that deliver nicotine without tobacco are risky. Stick with proven stop-smoking aids and steer clear of the following products: - Dissolvable tobacco products. Tobacco pouches, lozenges, strips or other products contain small amounts of tobacco and nicotine you hold or dissolve in your mouth. There is no evidence they will help you stop smoking and little is known about their health effects. - E-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices that heat liquid containing nicotine into a vapor to be inhaled. Because these products are new, there isn't much data about possible safety risks. Studies of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation have shown mixed results. For these reasons, e-cigarettes aren't recommended for people trying to quit smoking. - Flavored cigarettes. Clove cigarettes (kreteks) and flavored cigarettes (bidis) carry the same health risks as smoking regular cigarettes and can cause additional health problems. Although they're banned in the United States, flavored cigarettes are available in other countries. - Hookahs (narghiles). These are water pipes that burn tobacco, and the smoke is inhaled through a hose. They are not safer than cigarettes. The water does not filter out toxins in the smoke, and the water and pipe have a risk of transmitting infections. - Nicotine lollipops and balms. Products containing nicotine salicylate are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and they pose a risk for accidental use by children. - Pipes and cigars. These products have similar, though less frequent, health risks as cigarettes, and they are not a safe alternative. - Smokeless tobacco and snuff (snus). These products contain nicotine in amounts similar to cigarettes and increase your risk of mouth and throat cancer, tooth and gum diseases, and other health problems. It's important to have a plan for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms are usually the most intense during the first week after you stop smoking. They may continue for several weeks, with declining intensity. Although most nicotine withdrawal symptoms pass within a month, you may occasionally experience a strong urge or craving to smoke months after stopping. Triggers or cues that were associated with your smoking can provoke these urges or cravings. Here's what you can do to help manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Regular physical activity has been found to reduce withdrawal symptoms and help people stop smoking. Exercise also helps avoid potential weight gain often associated with stopping. - Wait out cravings. Cravings or urges usually last less than five minutes. Wash the dishes, go for a walk or have a healthy snack, such as carrots, an apple or sunflower seeds, which will keep your mouth busy. Do something that keeps your hands busy, and before you know it, the urge will have passed. This is why you want to get rid of tobacco supplies when you decide to quit. You don't want to have any on hand when a craving hits. - Identify rationalizations. If you find yourself thinking, \"I'll just smoke one to get through this tough time\" or \"Just one won't hurt,\" recognize it as a message that can derail your plan. Review your reasons for quitting, and replace that thought with something positive to support your stopping. - Talk to a support person. If you're feeling anxious or depressed or need encouragement, a support person can help you get through a difficult craving. - Avoid high-risk situations. Know your triggers, and stay away from people, places and situations that tempt you to smoke. - Eat regular, healthy meals. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink more water. Many products claim to be smoking-cessation aids. Many also claim to be \"natural.\" Just remember that \"natural\" doesn't necessarily mean \"safe.\" Talk with your doctor before trying any alternative medicine treatments. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture involves stimulating points on the body, typically with thin, solid, metallic needles. Several studies have been conducted on the effects of acupuncture or acupressure for smoking cessation, but there's no definitive evidence that it works. - Herbs and supplements. A few studies have been conducted on the dietary supplements SAMe, silver acetate and St. John's wort for the treatment of tobacco dependence, but there is no current evidence that any natural product improves smoking cessation rates. - Hypnosis. Although no evidence supports the use of hypnosis - also called hypnotherapy - in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful. If you choose to pursue hypnosis, talk to your doctor about finding a reputable therapist. - Meditation. Although no evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful to reduce symptoms of anxiety.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

It starts as precancerous changes called dysplasia. Dysplasia can be detected by a medical test called a Pap smear. Dysplasia is fully treatable. That is why it is important for women to get regular Pap smears, so that precancerous cells can be removed before they can become cancer. Pap smear screening should start at age 21. After the first test: - Women ages 21 through 29 should have a Pap smear every 3 years. - Women ages 30 through 65 should be screened with either a Pap smear every 3 years or a Pap smear and HPV test every 5 years. - If you or your sexual partner has other new partners, you should have a Pap smear every 3 years. - Women ages 65 through 70 can stop having Pap smears as long as they have had 3 normal tests within the past 10 years. - Women who have been treated for precancer (cervical dysplasia) should continue to have Pap smears for 20 years after treatment or until age 65, whichever is longer.

              "text": "Nicotine and tobacco: The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine. Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed. - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong. Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks. Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can: - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression - Increase activity in the intestines - Create more saliva and phlegm - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include: - Intense craving for nicotine - Anxiety - Depression - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping - Bad dreams and nightmares - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated - Headaches - Increased appetite and weight gain - Problems concentrating You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke. It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking. There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone. To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences. Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking. A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of: - Gum - Inhalers - Throat lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patches You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms. Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong. Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of: - Gum - Inhalers - Throat lozenges - Nasal spray - Skin patches You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms. Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong. Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

Here are some of the effects:\n\n1. **Heart and Blood Vessels**: Smoking damages the cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure. Nicotine, a highly addictive substance in tobacco, raises blood pressure and heart rate, while carbon monoxide reduces oxygen delivery to organs and tissues.\n\n2. **Skin**: Smoking accelerates skin aging, causing wrinkles and age spots. It also reduces blood flow to the skin, which can lead to slower healing of wounds.\n\n3. **Teeth and Gums**: Smoking can lead to gum disease (periodontal disease), tooth loss, and oral cancer. The chemicals in tobacco smoke damage gums and bones supporting teeth.\n\n4. **Digestive System**: Smoking can cause stomach ulcers, acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD), and stomach pain. It also increases the risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, colon, and rectum cancers.\n\n5. **Eyes**: Smoking increases the risk of cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration, potentially leading to blindness.\n\n6. **Bones**: Smoking can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures. This is particularly concerning for postmenopausal women, who are already at higher risk for osteoporosis.\n\n7. **Immune System**: Smoking weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. This includes increased susceptibility to pneumonia and other respiratory infections.\n\n8. **Reproductive System**: In men, smoking can lead to impotence (erectile dysfunction) and reduced fertility. In women, it can cause menstrual irregularities, an increased risk of miscarriage, and complications during pregnancy.\n\n9. **Mood and Mental Health**: Smoking can contribute to anxiety, depression, and stress. While some people may believe that smoking helps them relax, nicotine is a stimulant that can actually increase stress and anxiety over time.\n\n10. **Brain**: Smoking affects brain function and can lead to addiction. Nicotine impacts neurotransmitter activity in the brain, affecting mood and behavior. There is also evidence that smoking can increase the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nQuitting smoking can reverse some of these effects and significantly reduce the risk of developing smoking-related diseases. It's a difficult process, but support systems, counseling, and medications can help.",

Try inhaling for a count of four, holding for a count of seven, and exhaling for a count of eight.\n2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and moving up to your head.\n3. **Mindfulness Meditation**: Focus on the present moment, without judgment. You can use apps like Headspace or Calm to guide you.\n4. **Journaling**: Write down your thoughts and feelings to process and release them.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes:**\n\n1. **Exercise Regularly**: Physical activity reduces anxiety symptoms. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day.\n2. **Get Enough Sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate your mood and reduce anxiety.\n3. **Healthy Eating**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n4. **Stay Connected**: Build a support network of friends, family, or a therapist.\n\n**Professional Help:**\n\n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: A type of talk therapy that helps you identify and change negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medications**: If your anxiety is severe or interferes with daily life, your doctor may prescribe medication, such as antidepressants or benzodiazepines.\n3. **Counseling**: A therapist can help you develop coping strategies and work through underlying issues contributing to your anxiety.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Limit Caffeine and Nicotine**: Both can exacerbate anxiety symptoms.\n2. **Take Breaks**: Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as reading, listening to music, or taking a warm bath.\n3. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend.\n\nRemember, everyone experiences anxiety differently, and it may take some trial and error to find what works best for you.

Your risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors you\u00a0have. One step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which can include: Heart-Healthy Eating. Adopt heart-healthy eating habits, which include eating different fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas), whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A heart-healthy diet is low in sodium, added sugar, solid fats, and refined grains. Following a heart-healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Physical Activity. Be as physically active as you can. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. Ask your doctor what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. Read more about Physical Activity and Your Heart. Quit Smoking. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Read more about Smoking and Your Heart. Weight Control. If you\u2019re overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control risk factors for\u00a0atherosclerosis. Other steps that can prevent or delay atherosclerosis include knowing your family history of atherosclerosis. If you or someone in your family has an atherosclerosis-related disease, be sure to tell your doctor. If lifestyle changes aren\u2019t enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your atherosclerosis risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises. \u00a0"

            "text": "Preventing atherosclerosis involves lifestyle modifications and, in some cases, medical interventions. Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in and on the artery walls (plaque). This buildup can lead to blockages, reducing blood flow and potentially leading to heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases. Here are some strategies to help prevent atherosclerosis:\n\n### Lifestyle Changes\n\n1. **Healthy Diet**: Focus on eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. The Mediterranean diet is often recommended as it is high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, olive oil, and fish.\n\n2. **Exercise Regularly**: Engage in regular physical activity to help maintain a healthy weight, lower blood pressure, improve lipid profiles, and enhance overall cardiovascular health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.\n\n3. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Being overweight, particularly around the waistline, can increase the risk of developing conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, all of which can contribute to atherosclerosis.\n\n4. **Quit Smoking**: Smoking damages the inner lining of blood vessels, making them more susceptible to the buildup of plaque. Quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk of heart disease.\n\n5. **Limit Alcohol Consumption**: Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can raise blood pressure and contribute to the development of heart disease. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation.\n\n### Managing Health Conditions\n\n1. **Control High Blood Pressure**: High blood pressure can damage and weaken the arteries, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Work with your healthcare provider to manage your blood pressure through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication.\n\n2. **Manage Cholesterol Levels**: High levels of LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol can contribute to plaque buildup. Dietary changes, exercise, and cholesterol-lowering medications (if prescribed) can help manage cholesterol levels.\n\n3. **Control Diabetes**: Diabetes can increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. Keeping blood sugar levels within target ranges can help reduce this risk.\n\n### Other Tips\n\n- **Get Enough Sleep**: Poor sleep patterns, including sleep apnea, can contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n- **Manage Stress**: Chronic stress can indirectly contribute to atherosclerosis by increasing the risk of smoking, overeating, and physical inactivity. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, exercise, or therapy, can be beneficial.\n\n### Medical Interventions\n\nIn some cases, lifestyle changes alone may not be enough to prevent or manage atherosclerosis. Your healthcare provider may recommend:\n\n- **Statins**: Medications that help lower cholesterol levels.\n- **Antiplatelet agents**: Medications like aspirin that can help prevent blood clots.\n- **Blood pressure medications**: Various types of medications can help control high blood pressure.\n\nIt's essential to work with your healthcare provider to assess your risk factors for atherosclerosis and to develop a personalized plan to prevent the condition. Regular check-ups can help monitor your heart health and make adjustments to your prevention plan as needed.",

Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in and on the artery walls (plaque). This buildup can lead to blockages, reducing blood flow and potentially leading to heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases. Here are some strategies to help prevent atherosclerosis:\n\n### Lifestyle Changes\n\n1. **Healthy Diet**: Focus on eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. The Mediterranean diet is often recommended as it is high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, olive oil, and fish.\n\n2. **Exercise Regularly**: Engage in regular physical activity to help maintain a healthy weight, lower blood pressure, improve lipid profiles, and enhance overall cardiovascular health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.\n\n3. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Being overweight, particularly around the waistline, can increase the risk of developing conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, all of which can contribute to atherosclerosis.\n\n4. **Quit Smoking**: Smoking damages the inner lining of blood vessels, making them more susceptible to the buildup of plaque. Quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk of heart disease.\n\n5. **Limit Alcohol Consumption**: Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can raise blood pressure and contribute to the development of heart disease. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation.\n\n### Managing Health Conditions\n\n1. **Control High Blood Pressure**: High blood pressure can damage and weaken the arteries, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Work with your healthcare provider to manage your blood pressure through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication.\n\n2. **Manage Cholesterol Levels**: High levels of LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol can contribute to plaque buildup. Dietary changes, exercise, and cholesterol-lowering medications (if prescribed) can help manage cholesterol levels.\n\n3. **Control Diabetes**: Diabetes can increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. Keeping blood sugar levels within target ranges can help reduce this risk.\n\n### Other Tips\n\n- **Get Enough Sleep**: Poor sleep patterns, including sleep apnea, can contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n- **Manage Stress**: Chronic stress can indirectly contribute to atherosclerosis by increasing the risk of smoking, overeating, and physical inactivity. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, exercise, or therapy, can be beneficial.\n\n### Medical Interventions\n\nIn some cases, lifestyle changes alone may not be enough to prevent or manage atherosclerosis. Your healthcare provider may recommend:\n\n- **Statins**: Medications that help lower cholesterol levels.\n- **Antiplatelet agents**: Medications like aspirin that can help prevent blood clots.\n- **Blood pressure medications**: Various types of medications can help control high blood pressure.\n\nIt's essential to work with your healthcare provider to assess your risk factors for atherosclerosis and to develop a personalized plan to prevent the condition. Regular check-ups can help monitor your heart health and make adjustments to your prevention plan as needed.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nAtherosclerosis (PREVENTION): Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay atherosclerosis and its related diseases. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors you\u00a0have. One step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which can include: Heart-Healthy Eating. Adopt heart-healthy eating habits, which include eating different fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas), whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A heart-healthy diet is low in sodium, added sugar, solid fats, and refined grains. Following a heart-healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Physical Activity. Be as physically active as you can. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. Ask your doctor what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. Read more about Physical Activity and Your Heart. Quit Smoking. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Read more about Smoking and Your Heart. Weight Control. If you\u2019re overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control risk factors for\u00a0atherosclerosis. Other steps that can prevent or delay atherosclerosis include knowing your family history of atherosclerosis. If you or someone in your family has an atherosclerosis-related disease, be sure to tell your doctor. If lifestyle changes aren\u2019t enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your atherosclerosis risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises. \u00a0\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Here are several strategies to help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes:\n\n### 1. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**\n\n- **Losing weight:** If you're overweight, losing weight can help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Even a small amount of weight loss, such as 5-10% of your current weight, can be beneficial.\n- **Healthy weight range:** Aim to keep your body mass index (BMI) in the normal range (18.5-24.9).\n\n### 2. **Follow a Healthy Eating Plan**\n\n- **Balanced diet:** Focus on eating a variety of foods that are low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n- **Mediterranean diet:** This eating pattern, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, olive oil, and fish, has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes.\n- **Watch carbohydrate intake:** Since carbohydrates can raise blood glucose levels, monitoring the amount and type of carbohydrates you eat can help manage blood sugar levels.\n\n### 3. **Be Physically Active**\n\n- **Exercise regularly:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like brisk walking) per week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise (like running) per week, or a combination of both. Include strength training exercises on two or more days a week.\n- **Increase daily activity:** Beyond structured exercise, increase your daily physical activity by taking the stairs, walking to work, or doing household chores.\n\n### 4. **Limit Sitting and Screen Time**\n\n- **Reduce sedentary behaviors:** Try to limit your sitting and screen time. Replace sitting with activities that involve moving your body.\n\n### 5. **Manage Stress**\n\n- **Stress management:** Chronic stress can raise blood glucose levels. Engage in stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n### 6. **Get Enough Sleep**\n\n- **Quality sleep:** Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Poor sleep can affect your body's sensitivity to insulin.\n\n### 7. **Monitor Your Risk Factors**\n\n- **Know your risk:** If you have risk factors such as a family history of diabetes, being over 45, having a sedentary lifestyle, or being part of a high-risk ethnic group, take proactive steps to reduce them.\n\n### 8. **Get Tested**\n\n- **Screening:** If you're 45 or older, get screened for diabetes every three years. Early detection can lead to early intervention.\n\n### 9. **Limit Alcohol and Avoid Smoking**\n\n- **Reduce alcohol consumption:** Limit alcohol intake to moderate levels (up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men).\n- **Quit smoking:** Smoking can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, which are complications of diabetes.\n\n### 10. **Consider Medications if At High Risk**\n\n- **Consult a healthcare provider:** If you're at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes, your healthcare provider may recommend medications like metformin.\n\nPreventing diabetes requires a long-term commitment to a healthy lifestyle. Making a few simple changes to your daily habits can significantly reduce your risk. Always consult with healthcare professionals before making major changes to your diet or exercise regimen.",

Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Don't smoke or use tobacco products**: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and is responsible for about 80-90% of all lung cancer deaths. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce your risk of developing lung cancer.\n2. **Avoid secondhand smoke**: If you don't smoke, avoid exposure to secondhand smoke from friends, family, or coworkers who smoke.\n3. **Test your home for radon**: Radon is a naturally occurring gas that can accumulate in homes, especially in basements and crawlspaces. High levels of radon can increase your risk of lung cancer. Use a radon testing kit or hire a professional to test your home.\n4. **Reduce exposure to air pollution**: Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), can increase your risk of lung cancer. Stay indoors when air quality is poor, and use air purifiers to reduce indoor pollution.\n5. **Wear protective gear**: If you work with asbestos, arsenic, or other carcinogenic substances, wear protective gear, including masks, gloves, and safety glasses.\n6. **Get screened**: If you're a heavy smoker (defined as someone who has smoked for 30 pack-years or more), talk to your doctor about lung cancer screening. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans can detect lung cancer early, when it's more treatable.\n7. **Maintain a healthy diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may help reduce your risk of lung cancer.\n8. **Exercise regularly**: Regular exercise can help improve lung health and reduce your risk of lung cancer.\n9. **Avoid exposure to certain chemicals**: Some chemicals, such as diesel exhaust, chromium, and nickel, can increase your risk of lung cancer. Take precautions when working with these substances.\n10. **Consider genetic testing**: If you have a family history of lung cancer or have been exposed to certain carcinogens, talk to your doctor about genetic testing to assess your risk.\n\nRemember, while these steps can help reduce your risk of lung cancer, they're not a guarantee against developing the disease.

If you have a family history of schizophrenia, talk to your doctor about your risk and any concerns you may have.\n2. **Prenatal care**: Research suggests that prenatal care and a healthy pregnancy may help reduce the risk of schizophrenia. This includes:\n\t* Getting regular prenatal check-ups\n\t* Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\n\t* Avoiding substance abuse, such as smoking and illicit drugs\n\t* Managing stress\n3. **Early childhood development**: Providing a nurturing environment and promoting healthy childhood development may help reduce the risk of schizophrenia. This includes:\n\t* Providing a stable and supportive home environment\n\t* Encouraging social and emotional development\n\t* Promoting cognitive development through play and learning activities\n4. **Substance abuse prevention**: Substance abuse, particularly cannabis and other illicit drugs, has been linked to an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Avoiding substance abuse and seeking help if you or a loved one is struggling with addiction may help reduce this risk.\n5. **Stress management**: Chronic stress has been linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia. Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as:\n\t* Exercise and physical activity\n\t* Mindfulness and meditation\n\t* Yoga\n\t* Spending time in nature\n6. **Nutrition and diet**: A healthy diet rich in essential nutrients may help reduce the risk of schizophrenia. Focus on:\n\t* Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources\n\t* Getting enough omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and other essential nutrients\n7. **Social support**: Building and maintaining social connections may help reduce the risk of schizophrenia. This includes:\n\t* Staying connected with friends and family\n\t* Joining social groups or clubs\n\t* Volunteering in your community\n8. **Early intervention**: If you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking, seek help from a mental health professional.

              "text": "Heart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program."

Never delay seeking help if you or someone else is experiencing symptoms.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHeart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Autoimmune disorders: An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune disorders. The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances. When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues. The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder may result in: - The destruction of body tissue - Abnormal growth of an organ - Changes in organ function An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include: - Blood vessels - Connective tissues - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas - Joints - Muscles - Red blood cells - Skin A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include: - Addison disease - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) - Dermatomyositis - Graves disease - Hashimoto thyroiditis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Pernicious anemia - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sj\u00f6gren syndrome - Systemic lupus erythematosus - Type I diabetes Symptoms will vary based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include: - Fatigue - Fever - General ill-feeling (malaise) - Joint pain - Rash The health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease. Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include: - Antinuclear antibody tests - Autoantibody tests - CBC - Comprehensive metabolic panel - C-reactive protein (CRP) - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) - Urinalysis The goals of treatment are to: - Reduce symptoms - Control the autoimmune process - Maintain the body's ability to fight disease Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include: - Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease - Blood transfusions if blood is affected - Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are often called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TFN) blockers can be used for some diseases. The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic, but many can be controlled with treatment. Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk of infections. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders. Updated by: Laura J.

This type of disorder is classified as an autoimmune disease. The immune system normally produces antibodies to fight off foreign substances, but in autoimmune diseases, it produces autoantibodies that target the body's own tissues.\n\nThere are several types of autoimmune blood disorders, including:\n\n1. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)**: This condition occurs when the immune system produces antibodies against the red blood cells, marking them for destruction. As a result, the red blood cells are broken down faster than they can be replaced, leading to anemia.\n\n2. **Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)**: In ITP, the immune system produces antibodies against platelets, which are crucial for blood clotting. The antibodies mark platelets for destruction, leading to a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and an increased risk of bleeding.\n\n3. **Evans Syndrome**: This is a rare disorder characterized by the combination of AIHA and ITP, with or without other autoimmune conditions. Patients have low red blood cell and platelet counts due to immune system dysregulation.\n\n4. **Autoimmune Neutropenia**: This condition involves the immune system producing antibodies against neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important for fighting infections. The destruction of neutrophils leads to neutropenia, making it harder for the body to fight off infections.\n\nThe causes of autoimmune blood disorders are not fully understood, but they are believed to involve a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. Symptoms vary depending on the specific disorder but may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, easy bruising or bleeding, and an increased risk of infections.\n\nTreatment for autoimmune blood disorders depends on the specific condition and its severity. Common treatments include:\n\n- **Medications to suppress the immune system**, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.\n- **Targeted therapies**, such as rituximab, which targets specific cells in the immune system.\n- **Blood transfusions** to temporarily increase the number of healthy blood cells.\n- **Splenectomy** (removal of the spleen), which can be an option for some patients with severe cases of AIHA or ITP that do not respond to other treatments.\n\nEarly diagnosis and treatment are crucial to manage symptoms, prevent complications, and improve quality of life for individuals with autoimmune blood disorders.",

The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances. When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues. The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder may result in: - The destruction of body tissue - Abnormal growth of an organ - Changes in organ function An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include: - Blood vessels - Connective tissues - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas - Joints - Muscles - Red blood cells - Skin A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include: - Addison disease - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) - Dermatomyositis - Graves disease - Hashimoto thyroiditis - Multiple sclerosis - Myasthenia gravis - Pernicious anemia - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sj\u00f6gren syndrome - Systemic lupus erythematosus - Type I diabetes Symptoms will vary based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include: - Fatigue - Fever - General ill-feeling (malaise) - Joint pain - Rash The health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease. Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include: - Antinuclear antibody tests - Autoantibody tests - CBC - Comprehensive metabolic panel - C-reactive protein (CRP) - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) - Urinalysis The goals of treatment are to: - Reduce symptoms - Control the autoimmune process - Maintain the body's ability to fight disease Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include: - Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease - Blood transfusions if blood is affected - Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are often called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TFN) blockers can be used for some diseases. The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic, but many can be controlled with treatment. Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk of infections. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders. Updated by: Laura J.

              "text": "Pancreatic cancer: Pancreatic cancer is cancer that starts in the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach. It makes and releases enzymes into the intestines that help the body digest and absorb food, especially fats. The pancreas also makes and releases insulin and glucagon. These are hormones that help the body control blood sugar levels. There are different types of pancreatic cancers. The type depends on the cell the cancer develops in. Examples include: - Adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer - Other more rare types include glucagonoma, insulinoma, islet cell tumor, VIPoma The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. It is more common in persons who: - Are obese - Have a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables - Have diabetes - Have long-term exposure to certain chemicals - Have long-term inflammation of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) - Smoke Pancreatic cancer is slightly more common in women than in men. The risk increases with age. Family history of the disease also slightly increases the chance of developing this cancer. A tumor (cancer) in the pancreas may grow without any symptoms at first. This means the cancer is often advanced when it is first found. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: - Diarrhea - Dark urine and clay-colored stools - Fatigue and weakness - Sudden increase in blood sugar level (diabetes) - Jaundice (a yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes) and itching of the skin - Loss of appetite and weight loss - Nausea and vomiting - Pain or discomfort in the upper part of the belly or abdomen The doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. During the exam, the doctor may feel a lump (mass) in your abdomen. Blood tests that may be ordered include: - Complete blood count (CBC) - Liver function tests - Serum bilirubin Imaging tests that may be ordered include: - CT scan of the abdomen - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - Endoscopic ultrasound - MRI of the abdomen Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (and what type) is made by a pancreatic biopsy. If tests confirm you have pancreatic cancer, more tests will be done to see how far the cancer has spread within and outside the pancreas. This is called staging. Staging helps guide treatment and gives you an idea of what to expect. Treatment for adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor. Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach. When the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended. When the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used. With advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the tube that carries bile is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage. This can help relieve loss of appetite, jaundice, and itching of the skin. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Some people with pancreatic cancer that can be surgically removed are cured. But in most people, the tumor has spread and cannot be completely removed at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy and radiation are often given after surgery to increase the cure rate (this is called adjuvant therapy). For pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed completely with surgery or cancer that has spread beyond the pancreas, a cure is not possible. In this case, chemotherapy is given to improve and extend one's life. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have: - Abdominal pain that does not go away - Back pain - Loss of appetite - Unexplained fatigue or weight loss - Other symptoms of this disorder Preventive measures include: - If you smoke, now is the time to quit. - Keep a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. - Exercise regularly to stay at a healthy weight.

The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach. It makes and releases enzymes into the intestines that help the body digest and absorb food, especially fats. The pancreas also makes and releases insulin and glucagon. These are hormones that help the body control blood sugar levels. There are different types of pancreatic cancers. The type depends on the cell the cancer develops in. Examples include: - Adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer - Other more rare types include glucagonoma, insulinoma, islet cell tumor, VIPoma The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. It is more common in persons who: - Are obese - Have a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables - Have diabetes - Have long-term exposure to certain chemicals - Have long-term inflammation of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) - Smoke Pancreatic cancer is slightly more common in women than in men. The risk increases with age. Family history of the disease also slightly increases the chance of developing this cancer. A tumor (cancer) in the pancreas may grow without any symptoms at first. This means the cancer is often advanced when it is first found. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: - Diarrhea - Dark urine and clay-colored stools - Fatigue and weakness - Sudden increase in blood sugar level (diabetes) - Jaundice (a yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes) and itching of the skin - Loss of appetite and weight loss - Nausea and vomiting - Pain or discomfort in the upper part of the belly or abdomen The doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. During the exam, the doctor may feel a lump (mass) in your abdomen. Blood tests that may be ordered include: - Complete blood count (CBC) - Liver function tests - Serum bilirubin Imaging tests that may be ordered include: - CT scan of the abdomen - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - Endoscopic ultrasound - MRI of the abdomen Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (and what type) is made by a pancreatic biopsy. If tests confirm you have pancreatic cancer, more tests will be done to see how far the cancer has spread within and outside the pancreas. This is called staging. Staging helps guide treatment and gives you an idea of what to expect. Treatment for adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor. Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach. When the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended. When the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used. With advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the tube that carries bile is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage. This can help relieve loss of appetite, jaundice, and itching of the skin. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Some people with pancreatic cancer that can be surgically removed are cured. But in most people, the tumor has spread and cannot be completely removed at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy and radiation are often given after surgery to increase the cure rate (this is called adjuvant therapy). For pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed completely with surgery or cancer that has spread beyond the pancreas, a cure is not possible. In this case, chemotherapy is given to improve and extend one's life. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have: - Abdominal pain that does not go away - Back pain - Loss of appetite - Unexplained fatigue or weight loss - Other symptoms of this disorder Preventive measures include: - If you smoke, now is the time to quit. - Keep a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. - Exercise regularly to stay at a healthy weight.

Although there's no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it's never too late to get help. Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome may include: - Testosterone replacement therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone replacement can be given to help stimulate changes that normally occur at puberty, such as developing a deeper voice, growing facial and body hair, and increasing muscle mass and penis size. Testosterone therapy can also improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It will not result in testicle enlargement or improve infertility. - Breast tissue removal. In males who develop enlarged breasts, excess breast tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, leaving a more normal-looking chest. - Speech and physical therapy. These treatments can help boys with Klinefelter syndrome overcome problems with speech, language and muscle weakness. - Educational evaluation and support. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have trouble learning and socializing and can benefit from extra assistance. Talk to your child's teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support might help. - Fertility treatment. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to father children because few or no sperm are produced in the testicles. For some men with minimal sperm production, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is removed from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg. - Psychological counseling. Having Klinefelter syndrome can be a challenge, especially during puberty and young adulthood. For men with the condition, coping with infertility can be difficult. A family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help work through the emotional issues."

          "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert tasked with evaluating the quality of a\nresponse to a consumer health question.\nYour goal is to assess how well the generated response answers the medical question,\nand how it compares to the gold response in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe question will be provided in these tags:\n<question>\nwhat are symptoms of a nonfunctioning gallbladder\n</question>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nA nonfunctioning gallbladder, also known as acalculous gallbladder disease or gallbladder dysfunction, occurs when the gallbladder does not contract or release bile properly, leading to impaired digestion and potentially causing various symptoms. The symptoms of a nonfunctioning gallbladder can vary from person to person, but common ones include:\n\n1. **Abdominal pain**: Pain in the upper right or middle abdomen, which may radiate to the back or right shoulder. The pain can be dull, sharp, or crampy and may occur intermittently or persistently.\n\n2. **Digestive issues**: \n   - **Bloating and gas**: Feeling uncomfortably full, bloated, or gassy after eating, which can be due to impaired bile release.\n   - **Nausea and vomiting**: Feeling queasy or vomiting, especially after consuming fatty foods.\n\n3. **Fatty food intolerance**: Difficulty digesting fatty foods, which can lead to diarrhea, greasy stools (steatorrhea), or abdominal discomfort.\n\n4. **Malabsorption**: Inadequate bile release can lead to poor absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).\n\n5. **Changes in bowel movements**: Diarrhea or constipation can occur due to the altered bile flow.\n\n6. **Fatigue and malaise**: General feeling of tiredness, weakness, or discomfort.\n\n7. **Weight loss**: Unintentional weight loss due to malabsorption of nutrients.\n\n8. **Jaundice (in severe cases)**: Yellowing of the skin and eyes if the condition progresses and bile ducts become obstructed.\n\nIt's essential to note that some people with a nonfunctioning gallbladder may not exhibit any noticeable symptoms at all. If you are experiencing persistent or severe symptoms suggestive of gallbladder dysfunction, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis. They may perform tests such as an ultrasound, hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, or blood tests to assess liver and gallbladder function. Treatment options may range from dietary modifications and medications to surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) in some cases.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nGallbladder removal - open (Why the Procedure is Performed): You may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from gallstones. You may also need surgery if your gallbladder is not working normally. Common symptoms may include: - Indigestion, including bloating, heartburn, and gas - Nausea and vomiting - Pain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your belly (epigastric pain) The most common way to remove the gallbladder is by using a medical instrument called a laparoscope (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Open gallbladder surgery is used when laparoscopic surgery cannot be done safely. In some cases, the surgeon needs to switch to an open surgery if laparoscopic surgery cannot be successfully continued. Other reasons for removing the gallbladder by open surgery: - Unexpected bleeding during the laparoscopic operation - Obesity - Pancreatitis (inflammation in the pancreas) - Pregnancy (third trimester) - Severe liver problems - Past surgeries in the same area of your belly\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Understanding these causes can help in taking appropriate measures to prevent or delay tooth loss. Here are the primary causes:\n\n### Preventable or Largely Manageable Causes:\n\n1. **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Inadequate brushing and flossing lead to the accumulation of plaque and tartar on teeth, causing cavities (dental caries) and gum disease. If not addressed, these conditions can progress to tooth loss.\n\n2. **Gum Disease (Periodontal Disease):** This is a serious infection of the gums that damages the soft tissue and, without treatment, can destroy the bone supporting your teeth. It's a leading cause of tooth loss in adults.\n\n3. **Diet High in Sugars and Acids:** Consuming a diet high in sugars and acids increases the risk of tooth decay and erosion, which can lead to tooth loss.\n\n4. **Smoking and Tobacco Use:** Tobacco use in any form (smoking, chewing, etc.) is linked to an increased risk of periodontal disease and tooth loss.\n\n5. **Trauma:** Accidents or injuries can cause direct damage to teeth, potentially leading to their loss.\n\n### Unavoidable or Less Controllable Causes:\n\n1. **Genetics:** Some people may be more prone to tooth loss due to genetic factors, including the tendency towards gum disease or weaker enamel.\n\n2. **Aging:** Tooth loss becomes more common as people age. This can be due to a combination of factors, including longer exposure to potential risks, increased incidence of gum disease, and other health issues.\n\n3. **Systemic Diseases:** Certain conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis, can increase the risk of tooth loss by affecting the health of the gums and bone structure.\n\n4. **Medications:** Some medications can have side effects that affect oral health, such as reducing saliva flow, which can increase the risk of tooth decay and loss.\n\n5. **Bruxism:** Grinding or clenching of teeth, often during sleep, can wear down tooth enamel and lead to tooth loss over time.\n\n### Prevention:\n\nPreventing tooth loss largely involves good oral hygiene practices, a healthy diet, regular dental check-ups, and avoiding tobacco products.

Early prostate cancer usually does not cause symptoms. However, if prostate cancer develops and is not treated, it can cause these symptoms: - a need to urinate frequently, especially at night - difficulty starting urination or holding back urine - inability to urinate - weak or interrupted flow of urine - painful or burning urination - difficulty in having an erection - painful ejaculation - blood in urine or semen - pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. a need to urinate frequently, especially at night difficulty starting urination or holding back urine inability to urinate weak or interrupted flow of urine painful or burning urination difficulty in having an erection painful ejaculation blood in urine or semen pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. Any of these symptoms may be caused by cancer, but more often they are due to enlargement of the prostate, which is not cancer. If You Have Symptoms If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a urologist to find out if you need treatment. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the genitourinary system. The doctor will ask questions about your medical history and perform an exam to try to find the cause of the prostate problems. The PSA Test The doctor may also suggest a blood test to check your prostate specific antigen, or PSA, level. PSA levels can be high not only in men who have prostate cancer, but also in men with an enlarged prostate gland and men with infections of the prostate. PSA tests may be very useful for early cancer diagnosis. However, PSA tests alone do not always tell whether or not cancer is present. PSA screening for prostate cancer is not perfect. (Screening tests check for disease in a person who shows no symptoms.) Most men with mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer, and many men with prostate cancer have normal levels of PSA. A recent study revealed that men with low prostate specific antigen levels, or PSA, may still have prostate cancer. Also, the digital rectal exam can miss many prostate cancers. Other Tests The doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. But to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. During a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. If Cancer is Present If a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. Doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope. One way of grading prostate cancer, called the Gleason system, uses scores of 2 to 10. Another system uses G1 through G4. The higher the score, the higher the grade of the tumor. High-grade tumors grow more quickly and are more likely to spread than low-grade tumors."

              "text": "Headache (Causes): The most common type of headache is tension headache. It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. A tension headache: - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. - Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore. A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine: - The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. It may spread to both sides. - The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around. - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache. Other types of headaches: - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning. - Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome. - Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area. In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something more serious, such as: - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) - Blood pressure that is very high - Brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, or abscess - Brain tumor - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Lack of oxygen during sleep (sleep apnea) - Problems with the blood vessels and bleeding in the brain, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain aneurysm, or stroke"

It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. A tension headache: - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. - Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore. A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine: - The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. It may spread to both sides. - The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around. - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache. Other types of headaches: - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning. - Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome. - Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area. In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something more serious, such as: - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) - Blood pressure that is very high - Brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, or abscess - Brain tumor - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Lack of oxygen during sleep (sleep apnea) - Problems with the blood vessels and bleeding in the brain, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain aneurysm, or stroke\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\""

The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\"\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Hypoglycemia (Causes): Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low. There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria. - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia. - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia. - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery."

Treatment typically involves consuming fast-acting carbohydrates to raise blood sugar levels quickly.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHypoglycemia (Causes): Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low. There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria. - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia. - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia. - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

This inflammation causes the air sacs to fill with fluid and pus. Bacteria Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Many types of bacteria can cause bacterial pneumonia. Streptococcus\u00a0pneumoniae or pneumococcus bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the United States. If your pneumonia is caused by one of the following types of bacteria, it is called atypical pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila.\u00a0This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains. Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\u00a0This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However,\u00a0Mycoplasma pneumoniae\u00a0can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis. This type of bacteria is a common cause of \u201cwalking pneumonia\u201d. Chlamydia pneumoniae.\u00a0This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a viral cold or the flu. Bacterial pneumonia often affects just one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia. Read more Most of the time, the body filters bacteria out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system, the shape of your nose and throat, your ability to\u00a0cough, and fine, hair-like structures called cilia help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. Read How the Lungs Work for more information. Sometimes bacteria manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if: Your immune system is weak A germ is very strong Your body fails to filter out the bacteria from the air that you breathe. For example, if you can't cough because you've had a\u00a0stroke\u00a0or are sedated, bacteria may remain in your airways. When bacteria reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the bacteria. These cells cause inflammation in alveoli (air sacs) and can cause these spaces to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia. Viruses Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. The influenza or flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in children younger than one year old. \u00a0Other viruses can cause pneumonia such as the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about one to three weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia. Fungi Pneumocystis pneumonia is a serious fungal infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. It occurs in people who have weak immune systems due to HIV/AIDS or the long-term use of medicines that suppress their immune systems, such as those used to treat cancer or as part of organ or\u00a0blood and marrow stem cell transplant procedures. Other fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia. The following are three fungi that occur in the soil in some parts of the United States and can cause some people to get pneumonia. Coccidioidomycosis. This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest. It is the cause of valley fever. Histoplasmosis. This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. Cryptococcus. This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings."

            "output": {
              "text": "Chronic kidney disease: Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include: - Nausea - Vomiting - Loss of appetite - Fatigue and weakness - Sleep problems - Changes in how much you urinate - Decreased mental sharpness - Muscle twitches and cramps - Swelling of feet and ankles - Persistent itching - Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart - Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs - High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: - Type 1 or type 2 diabetes - High blood pressure - Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli) - Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures - Polycystic kidney disease - Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers - Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys - Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis) Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: - Diabetes - High blood pressure - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Smoking - Obesity - Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American - Family history of kidney disease - Abnormal kidney structure - Older age Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include: - Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) - A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures - Anemia - Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility - Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures - Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection - Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium) - Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus - Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival As a first step toward diagnosis of kidney disease, your doctor discusses your personal and family history with you. Among other things, your doctor might ask questions about whether you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, if you've taken a medication that might affect kidney function, if you've noticed changes in your urinary habits, and whether you have any family members who have kidney disease. Next, your doctor performs a physical exam, also checking for signs of problems with your heart or blood vessels, and conducts a neurological exam. For kidney disease diagnosis, you may also need certain tests and procedures, such as: - Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood. - Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases. - Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle that's inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what's causing your kidney problem. Depending on the underlying cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure. Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you may need treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Treating the cause Your doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary, depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, has been controlled. Treating complications Kidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments may include: - High blood pressure medications. People with kidney disease may experience worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend medications to lower your blood pressure - commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers - and to preserve kidney function. High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you may need frequent blood tests to monitor your condition. Your doctor will likely also recommend a water pill (diuretic) and a low-salt diet. - Medications to lower cholesterol levels. Your doctor may recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often experience high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease. - Medications to treat anemia. In certain situations, your doctor may recommend supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron. Erythropoietin supplements aid in production of more red blood cells, which may relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia. - Medications to relieve swelling. People with chronic kidney disease may retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs, as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body. - Medications to protect your bones. Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You may also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood, and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification). - A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood. As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor may recommend eating less protein. Your doctor may also ask you to meet with a dietitian who can suggest ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet. Your doctor may recommend follow-up testing at regular intervals to see whether your kidney disease remains stable or progresses. Treatment for end-stage kidney disease If your kidneys can't keep up with waste and fluid clearance on their own and you develop complete or near-complete kidney failure, you have end-stage kidney disease. At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. - Dialysis. Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood. In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube (catheter) inserted into your abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a period of time, the dialysis solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it. - Kidney transplant. A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can come from deceased or living donors. You'll need to take medications for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ. You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant. For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option is to treat kidney failure with conservative measures. However, once you have complete kidney failure, your life expectancy generally would be only a few months. Potential future treatments Regenerative medicine holds the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that today are beyond repair. Regenerative medicine approaches include: - Boosting the body's natural ability to heal itself - Using healthy cells, tissues or organs from a living or deceased donor to replace damaged ones - Delivering specific types of cells or cell products to diseased tissues or organs to restore tissue and organ function For people with chronic kidney disease, regenerative medicine approaches may be developed in the future to help slow progression of the disease. As part of your treatment for chronic kidney disease, your doctor may recommend a special diet to help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian who can analyze your current diet and suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys. Depending on your situation, kidney function and overall health, your dietitian may recommend that you: - Avoid products with added salt. Lower the amount of sodium you eat each day by avoiding products with added salt, including many convenience foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses. - Choose lower potassium foods. Your dietitian may recommend that you choose lower potassium foods at each meal. High-potassium foods include bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Examples of low-potassium foods include apples, cabbage, carrots, green beans, grapes and strawberries. Be aware that many salt substitutes contain potassium, so you generally should avoid them if you have kidney failure. - Limit the amount of protein you eat. Your dietitian will estimate the appropriate number of grams of protein you need each day and make recommendations based on that amount. High-protein foods include lean meats, eggs, milk, cheese and beans. Low-protein foods include vegetables, fruits, breads and cereals."

Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include: - Nausea - Vomiting - Loss of appetite - Fatigue and weakness - Sleep problems - Changes in how much you urinate - Decreased mental sharpness - Muscle twitches and cramps - Swelling of feet and ankles - Persistent itching - Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart - Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs - High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: - Type 1 or type 2 diabetes - High blood pressure - Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli) - Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures - Polycystic kidney disease - Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers - Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys - Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis) Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: - Diabetes - High blood pressure - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Smoking - Obesity - Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American - Family history of kidney disease - Abnormal kidney structure - Older age Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include: - Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) - A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease - Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures - Anemia - Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility - Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures - Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection - Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium) - Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus - Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival As a first step toward diagnosis of kidney disease, your doctor discusses your personal and family history with you. Among other things, your doctor might ask questions about whether you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, if you've taken a medication that might affect kidney function, if you've noticed changes in your urinary habits, and whether you have any family members who have kidney disease. Next, your doctor performs a physical exam, also checking for signs of problems with your heart or blood vessels, and conducts a neurological exam. For kidney disease diagnosis, you may also need certain tests and procedures, such as: - Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood. - Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases. - Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle that's inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what's causing your kidney problem. Depending on the underlying cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure. Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you may need treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Treating the cause Your doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary, depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, has been controlled. Treating complications Kidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments may include: - High blood pressure medications. People with kidney disease may experience worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend medications to lower your blood pressure - commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers - and to preserve kidney function.

              "text": "Binge eating disorder: Binge eating disorder is the most common type of eating disorder in the United States. People with binge eating disorder often feel out of control and eat a large amount of food at one time (called a binge). Unlike other eating disorders, people who have binge eating disorder do not throw up the food or exercise too much. Binge eating disorder is a serious health problem, but people with binge eating disorder can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder is a type of eating disorder. Eating disorders are mental health problems that cause extreme and dangerous eating behaviors. These extreme eating behaviors cause other serious health problems and sometimes death. Some eating disorders also involve extreme exercise. According to the American Psychiatric Association, women with binge eating disorder feel out of control and eat too much (binge), at least once a week for at least three months. During binges women with binge eating disorder usually eat faster than normal, eat until they are uncomfortable, eat when they are not physically hungry, and feel embarrassed, disgusted, or depressed because of the binges. Women with this type of eating disorder may be overweight or obese. Women with eating disorders, such as binge eating disorder, bulimia, and anorexia, have a mental health condition that affects how they eat, and sometimes how they exercise. These eating disorders threaten their health. Unlike people with anorexia or bulimia, people with binge eating disorder do not throw up their food, exercise a lot, or starve themselves. People with binge eating disorder are often overweight or obese. But not all people with binge eating disorder are overweight, and being overweight does not always mean you have binge eating disorder. It is possible to have more than one eating disorder in your lifetime. Regardless of what type of eating disorder you may have, you can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder affects more than 3% of women in the United States. More than half of people with binge eating disorder are women.1 Binge eating disorder affects women of all races and ethnicities. It is the most common eating disorder among Hispanic, Asian-American, and African-American women.2,3,4 Some women may be more at risk for binge eating disorder. It can be difficult to tell whether someone has binge eating disorder. Many women with binge eating disorder hide their behavior because they are embarrassed. You may have binge eating disorder if, for at least once a week over the past three months, you have binged. Binge eating disorder means you have at least three of these symptoms while binging:8 People with binge eating disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. Researchers are not sure exactly what causes binge eating disorder and other eating disorders. Researchers think that eating disorders might happen because of a combination of a person's biology and life events. This combination includes having specific genes, a person's biology, body image and self-esteem, social experiences, family health history, and sometimes other mental health illnesses. Studies suggest that people with binge eating disorder may use overeating as a way to deal with anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety, or stress.9,10 Researchers are studying how changing levels of brain chemicals may affect eating habits. Neuroimaging, or pictures of the brain, may lead to a better understanding of binge eating disorder.11 Learn more about current research on binge eating disorder. Many, but not all, women with binge eating disorder are overweight or obese. Obesity raises your risk for many serious health problems:12 People with binge eating disorder often have other serious mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. These problems can seriously affect a woman's everyday life and can be treated. Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. It may be difficult to talk to a doctor or nurse about secret eating behaviors. But doctors and nurses want to help you be healthy. Being honest about your eating behaviors with a doctor or nurse is a good way to ask for help. Your doctor may also do blood, urine, or other tests for other health problems, such as heart problems or gallbladder disease, that can be caused by binge eating disorder. Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better. Treatment plans may include one or more of the following: Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat in healthy ways again.14 Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again. Binge eating disorder can cause problems getting pregnant and during pregnancy. Pregnancy can also trigger binge eating disorder. Obesity raises the level of the hormone estrogen in your body. Higher levels of estrogen can stop you from ovulating, or releasing an egg from the ovary. This can make it more difficult to get pregnant. However, if you do not want to have children right now and have sex, you should use birth control. Overweight or obesity may also cause problems during pregnancy. Overweight and obesity raises your risk for: Pregnancy can raise the risk for binge eating disorder in women who are at higher risk for eating disorders. In one study, almost half of the women with binge eating disorder got the condition during pregnancy. The research suggests that binge eating during pregnancy may be caused by:16 After pregnancy, postpartum depression and weight from pregnancy can trigger binge eating disorder in women with a history of binge eating. Women with binge eating disorder before pregnancy often gain more weight during pregnancy than women without an eating disorder. Researchers think that weight gain during pregnancy may cause some women who had binge eating disorder before pregnancy to binge eat during pregnancy.17 Yes. Women who have recovered from binge eating disorder, are at a healthy weight, and have normal menstrual cycles have a better chance of getting pregnant and having a safe and healthy pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you had an eating disorder in the past and are trying to become pregnant. Maybe. Some medicines used to treat binge eating disorder can pass through breastmilk. Certain antidepressants can be used safely during breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor to find out what medicine works best for you. Learn more about medicines and breastfeeding in our Breastfeeding. You can also enter a medicine into the LactMed database to find out if the medicine passes through breastmilk and about any possible side effects for your nursing baby.

Neuroimaging, or pictures of the brain, may lead to a better understanding of binge eating disorder.11 Learn more about current research on binge eating disorder. Many, but not all, women with binge eating disorder are overweight or obese. Obesity raises your risk for many serious health problems:12 People with binge eating disorder often have other serious mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. These problems can seriously affect a woman's everyday life and can be treated. Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. It may be difficult to talk to a doctor or nurse about secret eating behaviors. But doctors and nurses want to help you be healthy. Being honest about your eating behaviors with a doctor or nurse is a good way to ask for help. Your doctor may also do blood, urine, or other tests for other health problems, such as heart problems or gallbladder disease, that can be caused by binge eating disorder. Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better. Treatment plans may include one or more of the following: Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat in healthy ways again.14 Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again. Binge eating disorder can cause problems getting pregnant and during pregnancy. Pregnancy can also trigger binge eating disorder. Obesity raises the level of the hormone estrogen in your body. Higher levels of estrogen can stop you from ovulating, or releasing an egg from the ovary. This can make it more difficult to get pregnant. However, if you do not want to have children right now and have sex, you should use birth control. Overweight or obesity may also cause problems during pregnancy. Overweight and obesity raises your risk for: Pregnancy can raise the risk for binge eating disorder in women who are at higher risk for eating disorders. In one study, almost half of the women with binge eating disorder got the condition during pregnancy. The research suggests that binge eating during pregnancy may be caused by:16 After pregnancy, postpartum depression and weight from pregnancy can trigger binge eating disorder in women with a history of binge eating. Women with binge eating disorder before pregnancy often gain more weight during pregnancy than women without an eating disorder. Researchers think that weight gain during pregnancy may cause some women who had binge eating disorder before pregnancy to binge eat during pregnancy.17 Yes. Women who have recovered from binge eating disorder, are at a healthy weight, and have normal menstrual cycles have a better chance of getting pregnant and having a safe and healthy pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you had an eating disorder in the past and are trying to become pregnant. Maybe. Some medicines used to treat binge eating disorder can pass through breastmilk. Certain antidepressants can be used safely during breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor to find out what medicine works best for you. Learn more about medicines and breastfeeding in our Breastfeeding. You can also enter a medicine into the LactMed database to find out if the medicine passes through breastmilk and about any possible side effects for your nursing baby.

              "text": "COPD: Espa\u00f1ol \u00a0 Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause\u00a0coughing\u00a0that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants\u2014such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts\u2014also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand\u00a0how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions\u2014emphysema\u00a0and chronic\u00a0bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease."

              "text": "Epilepsy: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity\u2014from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development\u2014can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy."

The exact cause of OCD is not fully understood, but research suggests that it is the result of a combination of genetic, neurobiological, environmental, and psychological factors. Here are some of the key factors that are thought to contribute to the development of OCD:\n\n1. **Genetics**: OCD tends to run in families, suggesting that there may be a genetic component to the disorder. Studies have identified several genes that may be associated with an increased risk of developing OCD, but no single \"OCD gene\" has been identified.\n\n2. **Brain Structure and Function**: Research has shown that people with OCD have differences in brain structure and function compared to those without the disorder. Specifically, OCD has been linked to abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and caudate nucleus, which are parts of the brain involved in decision-making, planning, and response inhibition.\n\n3. **Neurotransmitters**: Imbalances in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate, have been implicated in OCD. For example, many people with OCD benefit from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are a type of antidepressant that increases serotonin levels in the brain.\n\n4. **Environmental Factors**: Environmental factors, such as stress, trauma, and significant life changes, can trigger the onset of OCD symptoms in some individuals. Infections, such as streptococcal infection, have also been linked to the development of OCD symptoms in some cases.\n\n5. **Psychological Factors**: Psychological factors, such as learned behaviors and coping mechanisms, may also play a role in the development of OCD. For example, some people with OCD may develop compulsive behaviors as a way of coping with anxiety or other emotions.\n\n6. **Autoimmune Factors**: There is growing evidence that autoimmune factors may play a role in the development of OCD, particularly in children. For example, some research has linked OCD to autoimmune disorders, such as pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).\n\nIt's likely that OCD is a heterogeneous disorder, meaning that it can result from different combinations of factors in different individuals.

Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jaw bone (maxillary hypoplasia), a broad nose, protruding nostrils (nares), an abnormally prominent brow, down-slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large low-set ears, and unusually thick eyebrows. Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), unusual prominence of the breastbone (pigeon chest, or pectus carinatum), dental abnormalities, and short, hyperextensible, tapered fingers. Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males. The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1). Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two. It is unclear how changes (mutations) in the DNA structure of the gene lead to the clinical findings."

It is caused by mutations in the RPS6KA2 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-2.\n\nThis gene mutation leads to a range of physical, developmental, and intellectual disabilities. The syndrome is characterized by:\n\n* Growth delays and short stature\n* Distinctive facial features, such as a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes, and a broad nose\n* Intellectual disability and developmental delays\n* Skeletal abnormalities, such as curvature of the spine and abnormalities of the hands and feet\n* Other features may include hearing loss, vision problems, and heart defects\n\nThe RPS6KA2 gene mutation that causes Coffin-Lowry syndrome is usually inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, which means that the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome and a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y chromosome. As a result, males are more severely affected by the condition, and females are often carriers of the mutated gene and may exhibit milder symptoms.\n\nIn some cases, Coffin-Lowry syndrome may result from a de novo mutation, which is a new mutation that occurs spontaneously in a person with no family history of the condition.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat is Coffin Lowry Syndrome?: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial (head and facial) and skeletal abnormalities, delayed intellectual development, short stature, and hypotonia. Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jaw bone (maxillary hypoplasia), a broad nose, protruding nostrils (nares), an abnormally prominent brow, down-slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large low-set ears, and unusually thick eyebrows. Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), unusual prominence of the breastbone (pigeon chest, or pectus carinatum), dental abnormalities, and short, hyperextensible, tapered fingers. Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males. The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1). Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two. It is unclear how changes (mutations) in the DNA structure of the gene lead to the clinical findings.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Some forms of lymphoma are very slow growing. You and your doctor may decide to wait to treat your lymphoma when it causes signs and symptoms that interfere with your daily activities. Until then, you may undergo periodic tests to monitor your condition. - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. The drugs are usually administered through a vein, but can also be taken as a pill, depending on the specific drugs you receive. - Other drug therapy. Other drugs used to treat lymphoma include targeted drugs that focus on specific abnormalities in your cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. - Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, involves using high doses of chemotherapy and radiation to suppress your bone marrow. Then healthy bone marrow stem cells from your body or from a donor are infused into your blood where they travel to your bones and rebuild your bone marrow."

The goal of treatment is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible and bring the disease into remission. Lymphoma treatments include: - Active surveillance. Some forms of lymphoma are very slow growing. You and your doctor may decide to wait to treat your lymphoma when it causes signs and symptoms that interfere with your daily activities. Until then, you may undergo periodic tests to monitor your condition. - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. The drugs are usually administered through a vein, but can also be taken as a pill, depending on the specific drugs you receive. - Other drug therapy. Other drugs used to treat lymphoma include targeted drugs that focus on specific abnormalities in your cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs use your immune system to kill cancer cells. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. - Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, involves using high doses of chemotherapy and radiation to suppress your bone marrow. Then healthy bone marrow stem cells from your body or from a donor are infused into your blood where they travel to your bones and rebuild your bone marrow.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Bronchitis: Espa\u00f1ol Bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) is a condition in which the bronchial tubes become inflamed. These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.) People who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath. Bronchitis Overview The two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing). Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed). Sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone. Several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis. Most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care. Chronic Bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. Viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual. Chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis. Acute bronchitis Chronic bronchitis Industrial bronchitis Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Sometimes bacteria can cause the condition. Certain substances can irritate your lungs and airways and raise your risk for acute bronchitis. For example, inhaling or being exposed to tobacco smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution raises your risk for the condition. These lung irritants also can make symptoms worse. Being exposed to a high level of dust or fumes, such as from an explosion or a big fire, also may lead to acute bronchitis. Chronic Bronchitis Repeatedly breathing in fumes that irritate and damage lung and airway tissues causes chronic bronchitis. Smoking is the major cause of the condition. Breathing in air pollution and dust or fumes from the environment or workplace also can lead to chronic bronchitis. People who have chronic bronchitis go through periods when symptoms become much worse than usual. During these times, they also may have acute viral or bacterial bronchitis. Bronchitis is a very common condition. Millions of cases occur every year. Elderly people, infants, and young children are at higher risk for acute bronchitis than people in other age groups. People of all ages can develop chronic bronchitis, but it occurs more often in people who are older than 45. Also, many adults who develop chronic bronchitis are smokers. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. Smoking and having an existing lung disease greatly increase your risk for bronchitis. Contact with dust, chemical fumes, and vapors from certain jobs also increases your risk for the condition. Examples include jobs in coal mining, textile manufacturing, grain handling, and livestock farming. Air pollution, infections, and allergies can worsen the symptoms of chronic bronchitis, especially if you smoke. Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis caused by an infection usually develops after you already have a cold or the flu. Symptoms of a cold or the flu include sore throat, fatigue (tiredness), fever, body aches, stuffy or runny nose, vomiting, and diarrhea. The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a persistent cough, which may last 10 to 20 days. The cough may produce clear mucus (a slimy substance). If the mucus is yellow or green, you may have a bacterial infection as well. Even after the infection clears up, you may still have a dry cough for days or weeks. Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), low fever, and chest tightness or pain. If your acute bronchitis is severe, you also may have shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Chronic Bronchitis The signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis include coughing, wheezing, and chest discomfort. The coughing may produce large amounts of mucus. This type of cough often is called a smoker's cough. Your doctor usually will diagnose bronchitis based on your signs and symptoms. He or she may ask questions about your cough, such as how long you've had it, what you're coughing up, and how much you cough. Your doctor also will likely ask: About your medical history Whether you've recently had a cold or the flu Whether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke Whether you've been exposed to dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds in your lungs. He or she also may: Look at your mucus to see whether you have a bacterial infection Test the oxygen levels in your blood using a sensor attached to your fingertip or toe Recommend a chest x ray, lung function tests, or blood tests The main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier. If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. Antibiotics usually aren't prescribed for acute bronchitis. This is because they don't work against viruses\u2014the most common cause of acute bronchitis. However, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. A humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. If your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. You take this medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists). If you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. These medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form). If you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. This treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen. One of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. If you smoke, it's very important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants, such as dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. You can't always prevent acute or chronic bronchitis. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for both conditions. The most important step is to quit smoking or not start smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For example, wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you use paint, paint remover, varnish, or other substances with strong fumes. This will help protect your lungs. Wash your hands often to limit your exposure to germs and bacteria. Your doctor also may advise you to get a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition. Lifestyle Changes The most important step is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. This will help keep your lungs healthy. Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling."

These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.) People who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath. Bronchitis Overview The two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing). Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed). Sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone. Several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis. Most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care. Chronic Bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. Viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual. Chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis. Acute bronchitis Chronic bronchitis Industrial bronchitis Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Sometimes bacteria can cause the condition. Certain substances can irritate your lungs and airways and raise your risk for acute bronchitis. For example, inhaling or being exposed to tobacco smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution raises your risk for the condition. These lung irritants also can make symptoms worse. Being exposed to a high level of dust or fumes, such as from an explosion or a big fire, also may lead to acute bronchitis. Chronic Bronchitis Repeatedly breathing in fumes that irritate and damage lung and airway tissues causes chronic bronchitis. Smoking is the major cause of the condition. Breathing in air pollution and dust or fumes from the environment or workplace also can lead to chronic bronchitis. People who have chronic bronchitis go through periods when symptoms become much worse than usual. During these times, they also may have acute viral or bacterial bronchitis. Bronchitis is a very common condition. Millions of cases occur every year. Elderly people, infants, and young children are at higher risk for acute bronchitis than people in other age groups. People of all ages can develop chronic bronchitis, but it occurs more often in people who are older than 45. Also, many adults who develop chronic bronchitis are smokers. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. Smoking and having an existing lung disease greatly increase your risk for bronchitis. Contact with dust, chemical fumes, and vapors from certain jobs also increases your risk for the condition. Examples include jobs in coal mining, textile manufacturing, grain handling, and livestock farming. Air pollution, infections, and allergies can worsen the symptoms of chronic bronchitis, especially if you smoke. Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis caused by an infection usually develops after you already have a cold or the flu. Symptoms of a cold or the flu include sore throat, fatigue (tiredness), fever, body aches, stuffy or runny nose, vomiting, and diarrhea. The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a persistent cough, which may last 10 to 20 days. The cough may produce clear mucus (a slimy substance). If the mucus is yellow or green, you may have a bacterial infection as well. Even after the infection clears up, you may still have a dry cough for days or weeks. Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), low fever, and chest tightness or pain. If your acute bronchitis is severe, you also may have shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Chronic Bronchitis The signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis include coughing, wheezing, and chest discomfort. The coughing may produce large amounts of mucus. This type of cough often is called a smoker's cough. Your doctor usually will diagnose bronchitis based on your signs and symptoms. He or she may ask questions about your cough, such as how long you've had it, what you're coughing up, and how much you cough. Your doctor also will likely ask: About your medical history Whether you've recently had a cold or the flu Whether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke Whether you've been exposed to dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds in your lungs. He or she also may: Look at your mucus to see whether you have a bacterial infection Test the oxygen levels in your blood using a sensor attached to your fingertip or toe Recommend a chest x ray, lung function tests, or blood tests The main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier. If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. Antibiotics usually aren't prescribed for acute bronchitis. This is because they don't work against viruses\u2014the most common cause of acute bronchitis. However, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. A humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. If your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. You take this medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists). If you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. These medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form). If you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. This treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen. One of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. If you smoke, it's very important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants, such as dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. You can't always prevent acute or chronic bronchitis. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for both conditions. The most important step is to quit smoking or not start smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For example, wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you use paint, paint remover, varnish, or other substances with strong fumes. This will help protect your lungs. Wash your hands often to limit your exposure to germs and bacteria. Your doctor also may advise you to get a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition. Lifestyle Changes The most important step is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. This will help keep your lungs healthy. Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

Here are things to try: - Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching. - Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area. - Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath. - Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin. - Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity. - Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness. - Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas. Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash. - Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early. - Antiviral medicine may be very important forthose who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids. - Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. Do NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reyes syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used. A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others."

However, there are several treatments and remedies that can help alleviate symptoms, reduce discomfort, and prevent complications. Here are some common approaches:\n\n1. **Rest**: Getting plenty of rest can help your body fight the infection more effectively.\n\n2. **Hydration**: Staying well-hydrated is important, especially if you have a fever. Fluids like water, clear broth, and electrolyte solutions can help.\n\n3. **Antipyretics/Analgesics**: Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) can help reduce fever and alleviate headache and body aches. It's essential to follow the recommended dosage instructions carefully. Aspirin should not be given to children with chickenpox due to the risk of developing Reye's syndrome.\n\n4. **Itching relief**: Calamine lotion or antihistamines can help with itching. Oatmeal baths or colloidal oatmeal (finely ground oatmeal) added to bath water can also provide relief.\n\n5. **Anti-itch creams and ointments**: In addition to calamine lotion, there are other over-the-counter creams and ointments designed to relieve itching.\n\n6. **Antiviral medication**: While not a cure, antiviral drugs like acyclovir, when started early in the course of the illness, can reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. This is usually reserved for specific cases, such as adults, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems.\n\n7. **Topical antiseptics**: Applying mild antiseptics to the skin can prevent infection of the skin lesions.\n\nFor most people, especially children, chickenpox runs its course in about 7-10 days. It's crucial to stay home from school or work until all the blisters have crusted over (usually around 6-7 days after the onset of the rash) to prevent spreading the virus to others.\n\nIn certain cases, such as in people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, or newborns, chickenpox can lead to serious complications. These individuals may require more aggressive treatment, including antiviral medications, and close monitoring by a healthcare provider.\n\nIf you suspect you or someone else has chickenpox, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate advice and treatment.\n</response>\n\nThe reference answer will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat are the treatments for Chickenpox?: Treatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try: - Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching. - Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area. - Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath. - Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin. - Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity. - Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness. - Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas. Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash. - Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early. - Antiviral medicine may be very important forthose who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids. - Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. Do NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reyes syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used. A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

It is common in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States. Symptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening. There is no specific treatment.

You can get it if an infected mosquito bites you. Dengue does not spread from person to person. It is common in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States. Symptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening. There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then, drinking lots of fluids, resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids.

Nilotinib (Tasigna) Grapefruit juice can increase how much Nilotinib (Tasigna) the body absorbs. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking Nilotinib (Tasigna) might increase the effects and side effects. Avoid drinking grapefruit juice if you are taking Nilotinib (Tasigna). Oxycodone (Oxycontin) The body breaks down oxycodone (Oxycontin) to get rid of it. Grapefruit juice can decrease how quickly the body breaks down oxycodone (Oxycontin). Drinking grapefruit juice while taking oxycodone (Oxycontin) might increase the effects and side effects of Oxycodone (Oxycontin). Primaquine Grapefruit juice can increase how much primaquine is available in the body. It is unclear what effects this might have. Be cautious with this combination. Saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase) Drinking grapefruit juice can increase how much saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase) the body absorbs. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase) might increase the effects and side effects of saquinavir. Sertraline The body breaks down sertraline to get rid of it. Grapefruit can decrease how quickly the body breaks down sertraline. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking sertraline can increase the effects and side effects of sertraline. Sunitinib (Sutent) The body breaks down sunitinib (Sutent) to get rid of it. Grapefruit can decrease how quickly the body breaks down sunitinib (Sutent). Drinking grapefruit juice while taking sunitinib (Sutent) can increase the effects and side effects of sunitinib (Sutent). But some research shows that the effect of grapefruit on sunitinib (Sutent) is not a big concern. Until more is known, follow any instructions on the sunitinib (Sutent) label related to intake of grapefruit. Tacrolimus Drinking grapefruit juice might increase the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood. Drinking grapefruit juice while taking tacrolimus might increase the risk for side effects. Talinolol Grapefruit juice can reduce how much talinolol is available in the body. Drinking grapefruit juice with talinolol might reduce the effects of talinolol. Theophylline Drinking grapefruit juice might decrease the effects of theophylline. There's not enough information to know if this is a big concern. Tolvaptan (Samsca) The body breaks down tolvaptan (Samsca) to get rid of it. Grapefruit can decrease how quickly the body breaks down tolvaptan (Samsca). Drinking grapefruit juice while taking tolvaptan (Samsca) can increase the effects and side effects of tolvaptan (Samsca). Warfarin (Coumadin) Warfarin (Coumadin) is used to slow blood clotting. Drinking grapefruit juice might increase the effects of warfarin (Coumadin) and increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. Be sure to have your blood checked regularly. The dose of your warfarin (Coumadin) might need to be changed. Minor Be watchful with this combination. Acebutolol (Sectral) Acebutolol (Sectral) is moved by pumps in cells in the body. Grapefruit might change how these pumps work and decrease how much acebutolol (Sectral) gets absorbed by the body. This could make this medication less effective. To avoid this interaction, separate taking this medication from consuming grapefruit by at least 4 hours. Amprenavir (Agenerase) Grapefruit might slightly decrease how much amprenavir (Agenerase) is absorbed by the body. But this interaction is probably not a major concern.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

              "text": "Staph infections: Staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria, types of germs commonly found on the skin or in the nose of even healthy individuals. Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or result in relatively minor skin infections. But staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and drainage of the infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond to common antibiotics. Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). As a result, signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include: - Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil, a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks. - Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually features large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust. - Cellulitis. Cellulitis - an infection of the deeper layers of skin - causes skin redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores (ulcers) or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too. - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced as a result of a staph infection may lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition features fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off - leaving a red, raw surface that looks like a burn. Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include: - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Dehydration - Low blood pressure Also known as blood poisoning, septicemia occurs when staph bacteria enter a person's bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of septicemia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body, to produce infections affecting: - Internal organs, such as your brain, heart or lungs - Bones and muscles - Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria and has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with: - A high fever - Nausea and vomiting - A rash on your palms and soles that resembles sunburn - Confusion - Muscle aches - Diarrhea - Abdominal pain Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Signs and symptoms may include: - Joint swelling - Severe pain in the affected joint - Fever Go to the doctor if you or your child has: - An area of red, irritated or painful skin - Pus-filled blisters - Fever You may also want to consult your doctor if: - Skin infections are being passed from one family member to another - Two or more family members have skin infections at the same time Many people carry staph bacteria and never develop staph infections. However, if you develop a staph infection, there's a good chance that it's from bacteria you've been carrying around for some time. These bacteria can also be transmitted from person to person. Because staph bacteria are so hardy, they can live on inanimate objects such as pillowcases or towels long enough to transfer to the next person who touches them. Staph bacteria are able to survive: - Drying - Extremes of temperature - Stomach acid - High levels of salt A variety of factors - including the status of your immune system to the types of sports you play - can increase your risk of developing staph infections. Certain disorders or the medications used to treat them can make you more susceptible to staph infections. People who may be more likely to get a staph infection include those with: - Diabetes who use insulin - HIV/AIDS - Kidney failure requiring dialysis - Weakened immune systems - either from a disease or medications that suppress the immune system - Cancer, especially those who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation - Skin damage from conditions such as eczema, insect bites or minor trauma that opens the skin - Respiratory illness, such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema Despite vigorous attempts to eradicate them, staph bacteria remain present in hospitals, where they attack the most vulnerable, including people with: - Weakened immune systems - Burns - Surgical wounds Staph bacteria can travel along the medical tubing that connects the outside world with your internal organs. Examples include: - Dialysis tubing - Urinary catheters - Feeding tubes - Breathing tubes - Intravascular catheters Staph bacteria can spread easily through cuts, abrasions and skin-to-skin contact. Staph infections may also spread in the locker room through shared razors, towels, uniforms or equipment. Food handlers who don't properly wash their hands can transfer staph from their skin to the food they're preparing. Foods that are contaminated with staph look and taste normal. If staph bacteria invade your bloodstream, you may develop a type of infection that affects your entire body. Called sepsis, this infection can lead to septic shock - a life-threatening episode with extremely low blood pressure. To diagnose a staph infection, your doctor will: - Perform a physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will closely examine any skin lesions you may have. - Collect a sample for testing. Most often, doctors diagnose staph infections by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of the bacteria. Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you're given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin."

Some strains of staph, like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are resistant to many antibiotics, including Keflex.\n\n2. **Severity and Location of the Infection**: The severity and location of the infection also play a critical role. Skin infections might be effectively treated with Keflex if the bacteria are susceptible. However, more severe infections (like those in the bloodstream, bones, or joints) might require more potent or different antibiotics.\n\n3. **Dosage and Duration of Treatment**: Taking the correct dosage for the full prescribed duration is crucial. Stopping the antibiotic too soon can lead to the infection not being fully cleared and potentially developing antibiotic resistance.\n\n4. **Allergy and Tolerance**: You must not be allergic to cephalosporins, a class of antibiotics to which Keflex belongs. Some people allergic to penicillin may also be allergic to cephalosporins.\n\nIt's essential to follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: Before taking Keflex or any antibiotic, you should consult a healthcare provider.

Most often, doctors diagnose staph infections by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of the bacteria. Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you're given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully analyze the <response> compared to the <gold_response> and the original <question>.\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Is the medical information correct?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the response fully answer the question and include important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the response easy for consumers to understand?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",
